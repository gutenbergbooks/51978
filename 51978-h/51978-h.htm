<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to the end of the book text, and before
the publisher's Book Catalog. Some Footnotes are very long.</p>

<p class="screenonly">To avoid duplication, the page numbering in the publisher's Book
Catalog at the back of the book has a suffix C added, so that for
example page [23] in the Catalog is denoted as [23C].</p>

<p>The 3-star asterism symbol in the Catalog is denoted by ⁂. On
some handheld devices it may display as a space.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover was created by the transcriber and is placed
in the public domain.</p>

<p>More detail can be found at the <a href="#TN">end of the book</a>.</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE A LA MODE.</h3>

<p class="pfs80">"'Tis from high life our characters are drawn."</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_001.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In his preceding prints Mr. Hogarth generally
pointed his satire at persons in a
subordinate situation, and took his examples
from the inferior ranks of society. From the
situation of his characters, and the minute precision
with which he displayed the scenes he professed to
delineate, we sometimes see little violations of that
decorum which is perhaps necessary in engravings
professedly designed for furniture. For this neglect
of delicacy some of his prints were censured; to
remove all apprehensions of this series being liable
to the same objections, they were thus announced
in the <cite>London Daily Post</cite> of April 7, 1743:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Hogarth intends to publish, by subscription,
six prints from copperplates, engraved by the best
masters in Paris after his own paintings; the heads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
for the better preservation of the characters and
expressions, to be done by the author, representing
a variety of modern occurrences in high life, and
called 'Marriage à la Mode.'</p>

<p>"Particular care is taken that the whole work shall
not be liable to exception, on account of any indecency
or inelegancy; and that none of the characters
represented shall be personal, etc."</p></div>

<p>The artist has adhered to his engagement: he has
struck at an higher order, and displayed the follies
and vices which frequently degrade our nobility. He
has exhibited the prospect of a fashionable marriage,
where the gentleman is attracted by riches, and the
lady by ambition. That misery and destruction
succeeded an union founded upon such principles is
not to be wondered at; the progress of that misery,
and the final destruction of the actors, is so delineated
as to form a regular and well-divided tragedy. In
the first act are represented five principal characters;
and three of them, by a regular chain of incidents
naturally flowing from each other, fall victims to
their own vices. The young nobleman, for attempting
to revenge the violation of his wife's virtue, which
he never cherished, is killed by her paramour, who
for this murder suffers an ignominious death; and the
lady, distracted at the reflection of having been the
cause of their lives terminating in so horrid a manner,
makes her own quietus with a dose of laudanum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
This is painting to the understanding, appealing to
the heart, and making the pencil an advocate in the
cause of morality. It is doing that poetical justice
which our dramatists have sometimes neglected, and
in which they have perhaps been justified by the
common events of human life; for it must be acknowledged,
that while virtue is frequently unfortunate, we
often see vice successful. Notwithstanding this, those
pictures are surely best calculated to encourage men
in the practice of the social duties which display
the evils consequent upon their violation. Whatever
poetical justice may allow, morality demands that
some examples should be held up to prove "that
the omission of a duty frequently leads to the perpetration
of a crime; and that crimes of so black a
dye as are here represented, almost invariably terminate
in wretchedness, infamy, and death."</p>

<p>The original pictures were, on the 6th of June 1750,
purchased by Mr. Lane of Hillingdon, near Uxbridge,
for one hundred and twenty guineas!&mdash;a price so inadequate
to their merit, and to what it might have
been fairly presumed they would have produced even
at that time, that it becomes difficult to account for
it in any other way than by supposing that the strange
way in which Mr. Hogarth ordered the auction to
be conducted puzzled the public, who, not exactly
comprehending this new mode of bidding, declined
attending or bidding at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The following particulars relative to the sale were
communicated by Mr. Lane to Mr. John Nichols:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some time after the pictures had been finished,
perhaps six or seven years, they were advertised to be
sold by a sort of auction, not carried on by personal
bidding, but by a written ticket, on which every one
was to put the price he would give, with his name
subscribed to it. These papers were to be received by
Mr. Hogarth for the space of one month, and the
highest bidder at twelve o'clock, on the last day of
the month, was to be the purchaser: none but those
who had in writing made their biddings were to be
admitted on the day that was to determine the sale.
This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelle</i> method of proceeding probably disobliged
the public, and there seemed to be at that
time a combination against poor Hogarth, who, perhaps,
from the extraordinary and frequent approbation
of his works, might have imbibed some degree
of vanity, which the town in general, friends and foes,
seemed resolved to mortify. If this was the case (and
to me it is very apparent), they fully effected their
design; for on the memorable 6th of June 1750, which
was to decide the fate of this capital work, about
eleven o'clock, Mr. Lane, the fortunate purchaser,
arrived at the Golden Head, when, to his great surprise,
expecting (what he had been a witness to
in 1745, when Hogarth disposed of many of his
pictures) to have found his painting room full of noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and great personages, he only found the painter and
his ingenious friend Dr. Parsons, secretary to the
Royal Society, talking together, and expecting a
number of spectators at least, if not of buyers. Mr.
Hogarth then produced the highest bidding, from a
gentleman well known, of £110. Nobody coming in,
about ten minutes before twelve, by the decisive clock
in the room, Mr. Lane told Mr. Hogarth he would
make the pounds guineas. The clock then struck
twelve, and Hogarth wished Mr. Lane joy of his
purchase, hoping it was an agreeable one. Mr. Lane
answered, 'Perfectly so.' Now followed a scene of
disturbance from Hogarth's friend the Doctor, and
what more affected Mr. Lane, a great appearance of
disappointment in the painter, and truly with great
reason. The Doctor told him he had hurt himself
greatly by fixing the determination of the sale at so
early an hour, when the people in that part of the
town were hardly up. Hogarth, in a tone and manner
that could not escape observation, said, 'Perhaps it
may be so!' Mr. Lane, after a short pause, declared
himself to be of the same opinion; adding, that the
artist was very poorly rewarded for his labour, and if he
thought it would be of service to him, would give him
till three o'clock to find a better purchaser. Hogarth
warmly accepted the offer, and expressed his acknowledgments
for this kindness in the strongest terms.
The proposal likewise received great encomiums from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the Doctor, who proposed to make it public. This
was peremptorily forbidden by Mr. Lane, whose concession
in favour of our artist was remembered by
him to the time of his death. About one o'clock,
two hours sooner than the time appointed, Hogarth
said he could no longer trespass on his generosity,
but that if he was pleased with his purchase, he himself
was abundantly so with the purchaser. He then
desired Mr. Lane to promise that he would not dispose
of the pictures without previously acquainting
him of his intention, and that he would never permit
any person, under pretence of cleaning, to meddle
with them, as he always desired to take that office
on himself. This promise was readily made by Mr.
Lane, who has been tempted more than once by Mr.
Hogarth to part with his bargain at a price to be
named by himself. When Mr. Lane bought the
pictures they were in Carlo Maratte frames, which
cost the painter four guineas a-piece."</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Lane the six pictures became
the property of his nephew Colonel Cawthorne, and
were in the summer of 1792 put up by auction at
Mr. Christie's, and the proprietor bought them in at
nine hundred guineas.</p>

<p>They were a short time afterwards purchased by
Mr. Angerstein, at one thousand guineas, and are
now in his very fine collection.</p>

<p>If considered in the aggregate,&mdash;in conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
character, drawing, pencilling, and colouring,&mdash;it will
not be easy, perhaps not possible, to find six pictures
painted by any artist, in any age or country, in which
such variety of superlative merit is united.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the publication of the first edition of these
volumes, the following description of "Marriage à la
Mode" was found among the papers of the late Mr.
Lane of Hillingdon; and his family believe it to be
Hogarth's Explanation, either copied from his own
handwriting, or given verbally to Mr. Lane at the
time he purchased the pictures. It is subjoined, that
the reader may form his own judgment:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 pfs70">OF THE PAINTINGS OF THE LATE MR. HOGARTH, CALLED</p>

<p class="p1 pfs100 lsp">MARRIAGE A LA MODE.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Where Titles deign with Cits to have and hold,</p>
<p class="verse">And change rich blood for more substantial gold;</p>
<p class="verse">And honour'd trade from interest turns aside,</p>
<p class="verse">To hazard happiness for titled pride."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Garrick.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p class="p1 pfs100"><em>The First Picture.</em></p>

<p>"There is always a something wanting to make men
happy: the great think themselves not sufficiently
rich, and the rich believe themselves not enough
distinguished. This is the case of the Alderman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
London, and the motive which makes him covet for
his daughter the alliance of a great lord; who, on his
part, does not consent thereto but on condition of
enriching his son;&mdash;and this is what the painter calls
marriage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i>.</p>

<p>"These sort of marriages are truly but too common
in England; and it is, moreover, not unfrequent
to see them unhappy as they are ill chosen. The two
figures of the Alderman and the Earl are in every
respect so well characterized that they explain themselves.
The Alderman, with an air of business,
counts his money like a man used to this employment;
and the Earl, full of his titles and the greatness
of his birth, which he lets you see goes as high
as William the Conqueror, is in an attitude which
shows him full of pride; you think you hear him say
<em>me</em>, <em>my</em> arms, <em>my</em> titles, <em>my</em> family, <em>my</em> ancestors:
everything about him carries marks of distinction;
his very crutches, the humbling consequence of his
infirmities, are decked with an earl's coronet; these
infirmities are introduced here as the usual consequence
of that irregularity of living but too frequent
among the great. The two persons who are betrothed,
on their parts are by no means attentive to
one another: the one looks at himself in the glass, is
taking snuff, and thinking of nothing; the other is
playing negligently with a ring, and seems to hear
with indifference the conversation of a kind of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lawyer who attends the execution of the marriage
articles. Another lawyer is exclaiming with admiration
on the beauty of a building seen at a distance,
and upon which the Earl has spent his whole fortune,
and has not sufficient to finish the same. A number
of idle footmen, who are about the court of this
building, finish the representation of the ruinous
pageantry in which the Earl is engaged."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100"><em>The Second Picture.</em></p>

<p>"That indifference between the parties which preceded
marriage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i> has not been wanting to
follow it. We unite ourselves by contract, and we
live separately by inclination. Tired and fatigued
one of another, such husbands and wives have nothing
in common but a house, tiresome to the husband, and
into which he enters as late as he can; and which
would not be less tiresome to the lady, was it not
sometimes the theatre of other pleasures, either in
entertainments or routs. There is here represented
a room where there has just been one of these routs,
and the company just separated, as you see by the
wax candles not yet extinguished. The clock shows
you it is noon; and this anticipation of the night
upon the day is not the slightest of those strokes
which are intended to show the disorder which reigns
in the house. Madam, who has just had her tea,
is in an attitude which explains itself perhaps too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
much. Be that as it will, the painter's intention is
to represent this lady neglected by her husband,
under dispositions which make a perfect contrast with
the present situation of this husband, who is just
come home, and who appears in a state of the most
perfect indifference; fatigued, exhausted, and glutted
with pleasure. This figure of the husband, by the
novelty of its turn, the delicacy and truth of its
expression, is most happily executed. A steward of
an old stamp, one of those, if such there be, who are
contented with their salary, seizes this moment, not
being able to find another, to settle some accounts.
The disorder which he perceives gives him a motion
which expresses his chagrin, and his fear for the
speedy ruin of his master."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100"><em>The Third Picture.</em></p>

<p>"The bad conduct of the hero of the piece must be
shown here; the painter for this purpose introduces
him into the apartment of a quack, where he would
not have been but for his debauchery. He makes
him meet at the same time, at this quack's, one of
those women who, being ruined themselves long
since, make afterwards the ruin of others their occupation.
A quarrel is supposed to have arisen between
this woman and our hero, and the subject thereof
appears to be the bad condition, in point of health, of
a young girl, from a commerce with whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
received an injury. This poor girl makes here a
contrast, on account of her age, her fearfulness, her
softness, with the character of the other woman, who
appears a composition of rage, madness, and of all
other crimes which usually accompany these abandoned
women towards those of their own sex. The
doctor and his apartment are objects thrown in by
way of episode. Although heretofore only a barber,
he is now, if you judge by the appearance he makes,
not only a surgeon, but a naturalist, a chemist, a
mechanic, a physician, and an apothecary; and to
heighten the ridicule, you see he is a Frenchman.
The painter, to finish this character according to his
own idea, makes him the inventor of machines extremely
complicated for the most simple operations;
as, one to reduce a dislocated limb, and another to
draw the cork out of a bottle."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100"><em>The Fourth Picture.</em></p>

<p>"This piece is amusing by the variety of characters
therein represented. Let us begin with the principal;
and this is Madam at her toilette: a French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de
chambre</i> is putting the finishing stroke to her dress.
The painter supposes her returned from one of those
auctions of old goods, pictures, and an hundred other
things which are so common at London, and where
numbers of people of condition are duped. It is
there that, for emulation, and only not to give place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to another in point of expense, a woman buys at a
great price an ugly pagod, without taste, without
worth, and which she has no sort of occasion for. It
is there also that an opportunity is found of conversing,
without scandal, with people whom you cannot
see anywhere else. The things which you see on
the floor are the valuable acquisitions our heroine has
just made at one of those auctions. It is extremely
fashionable at London, to have at your house one
of those melodious animals which are brought from
Italy at great expense; there appears one here,
whose figure sufficiently distinguishes him to those
who have once seen one of those unhappy victims of
the rage of Italians for music. The woman there is
charmed, almost to fainting, with the ravishing voice
of this singer; but the rest of the company do not
seem so sensible of it. The country gentleman,
fatigued at a stag or a fox chase, is fallen asleep.
You see there, with his hair in papers, one of those
personages who pass their whole life in endeavouring
to please, but without succeeding; and there,
with a fan in his hand, you see one of those heretics
in love, a disciple of Anacreon. You see likewise, on
the couch, the lawyer who is introduced in the first
picture, talking to the lady. He appears to have
taken advantage of the indifference of the husband,
and that his affairs are pretty far advanced since the
first scene. He is proposing the masquerade to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mistress, who does not fail to accept of it. The next
piece proceeds to present to you the frightful consequences
of this step."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100"><em>The Fifth Picture.</em></p>

<p>"The houses of bagnio-keepers are yet at Paris
what they were heretofore at London: but now the
bath is but the accessory, the appendix of the bagnio-keepers
of this country, and excepting two or three of
their houses, the others have for the principal view
of their establishment the reception of any couple,
well or ill sorted, who are desirous of a chamber, or a
bed, for an hour or a night. The price is fixed in
each house: there are some where you pay five
shillings, in others half a guinea: you enter both into
one and the other at any time with a great deal of
safety, and are received there with all the complaisance
imaginable. Nothing is better furnished, more clean,
and better conducted than these houses of debauchery.
The masqueraders often make assignations at these
places; and it is for such an assignation that our
heroine has accepted of the ticket which her lover
offers her in the former piece. A husband, whose
wife goes to the masquerade without him, is not
without his inquietudes; it is natural that ours here
has secretly followed his wife thither, and from thence
to the bagnio, where he finds her in bed with the
lawyer. They fight;&mdash;the husband is mortally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wounded: his wife, upon her knees, is making useless
protestations of her remorse. The watchmen enter;
and the lawyer, in his shirt, is getting out of the
window."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100"><em>The Sixth Picture.</em></p>

<p>"We are now at the house of the Alderman. London
Bridge, which is seen through the window, shows
the quarter where the people of business live. The
furniture of this house does not contribute to its
ornament;&mdash;everything shows niggardliness; and the
dinner, which is on the table, the highest frugality.
You see the tobacco-pipes set by in the corner: this,
too, is a mark of great economy. Some pictures you
see, upon very low subjects, to give you to understand
by this choice that persons who, like the Alderman,
pass their whole life in thinking of nothing but enriching
themselves, generally want taste and elegance.
Besides, everything here is contrasted with what you
saw at the Earl's: the pride of one, and the sordidness
of the other, are always equally ridiculous by
the odd subjects of the pictures which are there seen;
but generally in the choice of pictures, neither the
analogy, taste, or agreement one with another are
consulted. The broker only is advised with, who on
his part consults only his own interest, of which he
is much more capable of being a judge than he is of
painting; like a seller of old books, who knows how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to say, Here is an Elzevir Horace, or one of the
Louvre edition,&mdash;and who knows all this without
being acquainted with poetry, or capable of distinguishing
an epigram from an epic poem. There is
only one difference between a bookseller and a broker:
the first has certain marks by which he knows the
edition; and the other is obliged to have recourse to
inspiration, which is the only way whereby he is able
to judge infallibly, as he does, whether a picture is an
original or no. But to return to our subject. The
daughter of the Alderman, now a widow, is returned
to her father. Her lover has been taken and hanged
for the murder of her husband: this she has learned
from the dying speech which is at her foot upon the
floor. A conscience disturbed and tormented with
remorse is very soon driven to despair. This woman,
who by the consequence of her infidelity has destroyed
her husband, her lover, her reputation, and
her quiet, has nothing to lose but her life. This she
does by taking laudanum. She dies. An old servant
in tears makes her kiss her child, the melancholy
production of an unfortunate marriage. The Alderman,
more sensible of the least acquisition than of
the most tragical events, takes, without emotion, a
ring from the finger of his expiring daughter. The
apothecary is severely reprimanding the ridiculous
footman of the house who had procured the poison,
the effects of which finish the catastrophe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus ends this explanation; and whether it was
copied from what Hogarth wrote, or, as is more probable,
made up from verbal remarks which he had
made at different times, it does not in any material
points differ from the following description of the
plates, which was published some years before the
editor saw or heard of the above paper.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p class="noindent">It has been observed that woman, among savages,
is a beast of burden; in the East, a piece of furniture;
and in Europe, a spoiled child. Under the last
denomination we may safely class the heroine of this
history. She has all the pouting humours of a boarding-school
girl. This alliance originated in her father
wishing to aggrandize his family, and the sire of the
Viscount wishing to clear his estate. These purposes
answered, the two patriarchs troubled themselves no
further. A similarity of disposition, or union of
hearts, the nobleman considered as too vulgar an
idea for a man of rank; and in the citizen's ledger of
happiness there were no such items. Their dispositions
are strongly marked by the different objects
which engage their attention.</p>

<p>The portly nobleman, with the conscious dignity of
high birth, displays his genealogical tree, the root of
which is "William Duke of Normandy, and conqueror
of England." The valour of his great progenitor,
and the various merits of the collateral branches
which dignify his pedigree, he considers as united in
his own person, and therefore looks upon an alliance
with his son as the acme of honour, the apex of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
exaltation. While he is thus glorying in the dust
of which his ancestors were once compounded, the
prudent citizen, who in return for it has parted with
dust of a much more weighty and useful description,
paying no regard to this heraldic blazonry, devotes
all his attention to the marriage settlement. The
haughty and supercilious Peer is absorbed in the
contemplation of his illustrious ancestry, while the
worshipful Alderman, regardless of the past, and considering
the present as merely preparatory for the
future, calculates what provision there will be for a
young family. Engrossed by their favourite reflections,
neither of these sagacious personages regards
the want of attachment in those who are to be united
as worthy a moment's consideration. To do the
Viscount justice, he seems equally indifferent; for
though evidently in love&mdash;it is with himself. Gazing
in the mirror with delight,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and in an affected style
displaying his gold snuff-box and glittering ring, he
is quite a husband <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i>. The lady, very well
disposed to retaliate, plays with her wedding-ring,
and repays this chilling coldness with sullen contempt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
her heart is not worth the Viscount's attention,
and she determines to bestow it on the first suitor.
An insidious lawyer, like an evil spirit ever ready to
move or second a temptation, appears at her right
hand. That he is an eloquent pleader, is intimated
by his name, Counsellor Silvertongue: that he can
make the worse appear the better cause, is only saying
in other words that <em>he is great in the profession</em>.
To predict that with such an advocate her virtue is
in danger, would not be sufficiently expressive. His
captivating tones and insinuating manners would
have ensnared Lucretia.</p>

<p>Two dogs in a corner, coupled against their inclinations,
are good emblems of the ceremony which is to

<p>The ceiling of this magnificent apartment is decorated
with the story of Pharaoh and his host drowned
in the Red Sea. The ocean on a ceiling proves a
projector's taste,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and attention to the costume; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>sublimity of a painter is exemplified in the hero delineated
with one of the attributes of Jove. This
fluttering figure is probably intended for one of the
Peer's high-born ancestors, and is invested with the
Golden Fleece and some other foreign orders. To
give him still greater dignity, he is in the character of
Jupiter; while one hand holds up an ample robe, the
other grasps a thunderbolt. A comet is taking its
rapid course over his head; and in one corner of the
picture two of the family of Boreas are judiciously
blowing contrary ways. To some such supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
cause we must attribute the drapery and long peruke
flying in opposite directions. Immediately before
him a cannon is represented in the moment of explosion:
to leave the spectator no doubt of its being
intended for serious business, and not as a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i>,
the ball is seen in its progress. All this is
ridiculous enough, but not an iota more absurd than
many of the French portraits which Hogarth evidently
intended to burlesque by this parody.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Their
painters have mistaken extravagance for spirit, and
violence for freedom. Fine as are many of their engravings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
they frequently give us lines that resemble
the flourishes of a writing-master more than the free
strokes of an artist.</p>

<p>In the painting which represents Goliah slain by
David, the gigantic Philistine is stretched on the earth,
and, in truth, appears to cover many a rood. Beneath
is the <em>merciful</em> Judith: one hand grasps the sword
with which she decollated Holofernes, and the other
rests upon his bleeding head. The adjoining picture
exhibits a view of St. Sebastian pierced with arrows,
and that on the other side of the room displays
Prometheus and the vulture; beneath is a representation
of Cain slaying Abel. St. Lawrence upon the
gridiron is placed under a painting of Herod's cruelty.
As the ornament of a chandelier, over the sofa on
which the hymeneal pair are seated, is a relievo of
Medusa's head; both this and other <em>agreeable</em> subjects
may possibly have some covert allusions, but
to me they are not obvious.</p>

<p>Hogarth's leading object in them all seems to be a
ridicule of those who gave these barbarous delineations
a preference to his own paintings.</p>

<p>The self-important consequence of the noble inhabitant
of this mansion is displayed in every part of
his furniture. The coronet glitters not only upon
the canopy, but the crutches; is mounted upon the
frame of the mirror, and marked on the side of the
dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Nichols observes, that "among such little circumstances
as might escape the notice of a careless
spectator, is the thief in the candle, emblematical of
the mortgage on his lordship's estate."&mdash;As the mortgage
is now paying, one thinks the thief might have
been spared. The artist, however, might mean to
intimate that his lordship's estate was run to waste
by the negligence and carelessness of the proprietor.
The same commentator properly remarks that the
unfinished edifice seems at a stand for want of money,
no workman appearing on the scaffolds, or near
them; and adds, that a number of figures which are
before the building were designed for "the lazy vermin
of his lordship's hall, who, having nothing else to
do, are sitting on the blocks of stone, or staring at
the building."</p>

<p>The characters in this print are admirably marked.
Nothing can be better contrasted than the cautious,
calculating countenance of the Alderman, and the
haughty overbearing air of the Peer. To this may be
added the stare of the Serjeant, astonished at so magnificent
an edifice, and the cunning craft of the Usurer
delivering up the mortgage.</p>

<p>The plate was engraved by G. Scotin, and published

<p class="noindent">Wearied, languid, and spiritless from the dissipations
of the night, with his sword broken in a riotous frolic,
the modish Viscount comes home at noon, and finds
his lady just arisen, and seated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en déshabillé</i> at her
matin meal. From the melancholy cast of his countenance,
and both hands being in his pockets, we may
infer that he has been unsuccessful at the gaming-table.
A cap and riband, which hang out of his coat
pocket, lead us to suppose that part of his night has
been passed in the company of a female; and from
the attention a dog pays to the cap, we are led to
suspect that he may have originally belonged to the
lady who is its proprietor.</p>

<p>The Viscountess<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has been contemplating her face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>in a pocket-mirror, and is scarcely recovered from
the fatigue of a rout, which by the cards, instruments,
and music book on the floor, we conclude to have
been the preceding night's amusement.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>An ungartered servant, who is yawning in the
background, pays little attention to his master or
mistress, and is totally regardless of a chair, which is
in great danger from the blaze of an expiring candle;
this, with those left burning in the sockets since the
conclusion of their nocturnal revelry, must give a
pleasing perfume to the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>The old steward's attitude and countenance clearly
indicate that he foresees the gulf into which an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
united torrent of dissipation will inevitably plunge
this infatuated pair. He has brought a great number
of bills for payment: to one, and only one, is a receipt,
which, being dated January 4, 1744, determines
the time when vulgar tradesmen are extremely
troublesome to men of rank.</p>

<p>Of the paintings in this stately saloon, that of
which we see only a part is properly concealed by a
curtain. The four cartoons, very judiciously placed
in the same line, are, I believe, intended for the four
evangelists. Next to that which is opposite the
chandelier is a faint representation of another picture.
The lines are ambiguous, but seem intended to represent
a ship in a storm: a very proper emblem of the
wreck which is likely to succeed the negligence and
dissipation of this noble family. A marble head, in a
cut wig, perhaps intended for one of the Cæsars, with
the nose broken, to show that it is a genuine antique,
decorates the centre of the chimney-piece. In most
of the other grotesque and fantastic ornaments,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Gay china's unsubstantial forms supply</p>
<p class="verse">The place of beauty, strength, simplicity;</p>
<p class="verse">Each varied colour of the brightest hue,</p>
<p class="verse">The green, the red, the yellow, and the blue,</p>
<p class="verse">In every part the dazzled eyes behold,</p>
<p class="verse">Here streak'd with silver, there enrich'd with gold."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A painting over the chimney-piece represents Cupid
playing upon the bagpipes. Both subject and frame
prove the classical taste of the proprietor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ornaments round a clock are equally elegant and
peculiarly appropriate. It is encompassed by a kind
of grove, with a cat on the summit and a Chinese
pagoda at the bottom. If the branches were tenanted
by the feathered tribe, it would be no more than we
see every day; it would be vulgar nature. To make
it uncommonly grand, and peculiarly magnifique,
they are occupied by two fishes.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The crowned chandelier, candlesticks, chairs, footstool,
chimney-piece, and grate, are evidently made
from the designs of William Kent.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> To that fashionable
architect they are indebted for the plan of the
stupendous saloon, which has an air of grandeur and
magnificence that is not often seen in Mr. Hogarth's
works. It produces such a sensation as Pope describes
on seeing Timon's villa, "Where all cry out,
what sums are thrown away!"</p>

<p>This plate was engraved by Baron, but the old
steward's face is, I think, marked by the burin of
Hogarth.</p>

<p class="noindent">This has been said to be the most obscure delineation
that Hogarth ever published: how far the short
explanation copied from Mr. Lane's papers may contribute
to sanction my previous description, I do not
presume to judge. Hitherto there have certainly been
many different opinions as to the meaning of this
print, and Churchill is said to have asserted, that from
its appearing so ambiguous to him, he once requested
Hogarth to explain it, but that the artist, like many
other commentators, left his subject as obscure as he
found it. "From this circumstance," added the poet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>"I am convinced he formed his tale upon the ideas
of Hoadley, Garrick, Townley, or some other friend,
and never perfectly comprehended what it meant."</p>

<p>How it was possible for Hoadley, Garrick, and
Townley, or any other friend, to furnish Hogarth with
ideas to compose the third plate of an historical series,
I cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>I can suppose it possible that the artist might not
choose to explain to Churchill what he himself
thought obvious, and therefore declined giving him
any explanation. I can suppose that, admirably as
Hogarth told a story with his pencil, he might not be
qualified to express his verbal meaning with equal
accuracy, and therefore be misunderstood; but, above
all, I can suppose it not only possible, but probable,
that this bitter satirist, making the declaration <em>after</em>
the publication of "Wilkes' Portrait," "The Bruiser,"
and "The Times," might, from resentment to the artist,
be provoked to give a poetical colouring to the story
about the "Marriage à la Mode."</p>

<p>I think it must be considered as a sort of episode,
no further connected with the main subject than as it
exhibits the consequences of an alliance entered into
from sordid and unworthy motives. In the two preceding
prints the hero and heroine of this tragedy
show a fashionable indifference towards each other.
On the part of the Viscount, we see no indication of
any wish to conciliate the affections of his lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Careless of her conduct, and negligent of her fame,
he leaves her to superintend the musical dissipations
of his house, and lays the scene of his own licentious
amusements abroad. The female heart is naturally
susceptible, and much influenced by first impressions.
Formed for love, and gratefully attached by delicate
attentions; but chilled by neglect, and frozen by
coldness,&mdash;by contempt it is estranged, and by
habitual and long-continued inconstancy sometimes
lost.</p>

<p>To show that our unfortunate victim to parental
ambition has suffered this mortifying climax of provocation,
the artist has made a digression, and
exhibited her profligate husband attending a quack
doctor. In the last plate he appears to have dissipated
his fortune; in this he has injured his health.
From the hour of marriage he has neglected the
woman to whom he plighted his troth. Can we
wonder at her conduct? By the Viscount she was
despised; by the Counsellor adored. This insidious,
insinuating villain, we may naturally suppose acquainted
with every part of the nobleman's conduct,
and artful enough to make a proper advantage of his
knowledge. From such an agent the Countess would
probably learn how her lord was connected: from his
subtle suggestions, being aided by resentment, she is
tempted to think that these accumulated insults have
dissolved the marriage vow, and given her a right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
retaliate. Thus impelled, thus irritated, and attended
by such an advocate, can we wonder that this fair
unfortunate deserted from the standard of honour,
and sought refuge in the camp of infamy? To her
husband many of her errors must be attributed. She
saw he despised her, and therefore hated him; found
that he had bestowed his affections on another, and
followed his example. To show the consequence of
his unrestrained wanderings, the author, in this plate,
exhibits his hero in the house of one of those needy
empirics who play upon public credulity, and vend
poisons under the name of drugs. This quack being
family surgeon to the old procuress who stands at his
right hand, formerly attended the young girl, and
received his fee as having recovered his patient. That
he was paid for what he did not perform, appears by
the countenance of the enraged nobleman, who lifts
up his cane in a threatening style, accompanying the
action with a promise to bastinado both surgeon and
procuress for having deceived him by a false bill of
health. These menaces our natural son of Æsculapius
treats with that careless nonchalance which shows
that his ears are accustomed to such sounds; but the
haggard high priestess of the temple of Venus,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tenacious of her good name, and tremblingly alive to
any aspersion which may tend to injure her professional
reputation, unclasps her knife, determined to
wash out this foul stain upon her honour with the
blood of her accuser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The nick-nackitory collection that forms this motley
museum is exactly described by Doctor Garth; one
would almost think Hogarth made the dispensary his
model in designing the print.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Here mummies lie, most reverently stale,</p>
<p class="verse">And there, the tortoise hung her coat of mail:</p>
<p class="verse">Not far from some huge shark's devouring head,</p>

</div></div>

<p>An horn of the sea unicorn is so placed as to give
the idea of a barber's pole; this, with the pewter
basin and broken comb, clearly indicate the former
profession of our mock doctor. The high-crowned
hat and antique spur, which might once have been
the property of Butler's redoubted knight, the valiant
Hudibras, with a model of the gallows, and sundry
nondescript rarities, show us that this great man, if
not already a member of the Antiquarian Society,
is qualifying himself to be a candidate. The dried
body<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in the glass-case, placed between a skeleton
and the sage's wig-block, form a trio that might serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
as the symbol of a consultation of physicians. A
figure above the mummies seems at first sight to be
decorated with a flowing periwig, but on a close inspection
will be found intended for one of Sir John
Mandeville's <em>anthropophagi</em>, a sort of men "whose
heads do grow beneath their shoulders." Even the
skulls have character; and the principal mummy has
so majestic an aspect, that one is almost tempted to
believe it the mighty Cheops, king of Egypt, whose
body was certainly to be known, being the only one
entombed in the large pyramid.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>By two machines, constructed upon the most complicated
principles, though intended for performing
very simple operations, we discover that our quack
studies mechanics. On one of them lies a folio
treatise descriptive of their uses; by which we are
informed that the largest is to reduce a dislocated
limb, the smallest is to draw a cork!&mdash;each of them
invented by Monsieur De la Pilulæ, and inspected

<p class="noindent">By the old Peer's death our fair heroine has attained
the summit of her wishes, and become a Countess.
Intoxicated by this elevation, and vain of her new
dignity, she ranges through the whole circle of frivolous
amusements, and treads every maze of fashionable
dissipation. Her excesses are rendered still
more criminal by the consequent neglect of domestic
duties; for, by the coral on the back of her chair, we
are led to suppose that she is a mother. Her morning
levee is crowded with persons of rank, and attended
by her paramour, and that contemptible shadow of
man, an Italian singer, with whose dulcet notes two
of our right honourable group seem in the highest
degree enraptured. This bloated animal, carelessly
and consequentially leaning back in his chair, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dressed in a richly embroidered coat, and every finger
is loaded with a diamond. Though in a morning, his
solitaire, kneebands, and shoes are decorated with
gems.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He is quavering,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The seeming echo of what once was song,</p>
<p class="verse">Sweet by defect, and impotently strong."</p>
</div></div>

<p>That our extravagant Countess purchased the pipe
of this expensive exotic in mere compliance to the
fashion of the day, without any real taste for his
mellifluous warblings, is intimated by the absorbed
attention which she pays to the Advocate, who, with
the luxuriant indolent grace of an Eastern effendi, is
lolling on a sofa at her right hand. By his pointing
to the folding screen, on which is delineated a
masquerade revel,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> at the same time that he shows
his infatuated <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">inamorato</i> a ticket of admission, we see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>that they are making an assignation for the evening.
The fatal consequences of their unfortunate meeting
is displayed in the two succeeding plates. A Swiss
servant, who is dressing her hair, has all the grimace
of his country; he is the complete Canton of the
<cite>Clandestine Marriage</cite>. The contemptuous leer of a
black footman, serving chocolate, is evidently directed
to the singer, and forms an admirable contrast to the
die-away lady seated before him,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who, lost to every
sense but that of hearing, is exalted to the third heaven
by the enchanting song of this pampered Italian. On
the country gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> with a whip in his hand, it has
quite a different effect; with the echoing "Tally ho!"
he would be exhilarated; by the soft sounds of Italia,
his soul is lulled to rest. The <em>fine feeling</em> creature,
with a fan suspended from <em>its</em> wrist, is marked with
that foolish face of praise which understands nothing,
but admires everything that it is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</i> to admire!
The taper supporters of Monsieur <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en papillote</i> are
admirably opposed to the lumbering pedestals of our
mummy of music. The figure behind him<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> blows a
flute with every muscle of his face. A little black
boy in the opposite corner, examining a collection
of grotesque china ornaments which have been purchased
at the sale of Esquire Timothy Babyhouse, pays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>great attention to a figure of Acteon, and with a very
significant leer points to his horns. Under a delineation
of Jupiter and Leda, on a china dish, is written,
"Julio Romano!" The fantastic group of hydras,
gorgons, and chimeras dire, which lie near it, are an
admirable specimen of the absurd and shapeless
monsters which disgraced our drawing-rooms until
the introduction of Etrurian ornaments. By the fantastic
decorations upon a chimney-piece in the second
plate, we saw that our fashionable pair had a taste,
and this taste may have been one source of their embarrassments.
Another of their follies which, when
gaming is united to it, will level their lofty forests and
lay their proudest mansions in the dust, is displayed
in the cards of invitation scattered on the floor. They
afford a good specimen of polite literature, and the
writers deserve a niche in the catalogue of royal and
noble authors. The list follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Count Basset desire to no how Lady Squander
sleep last nite."</p>

<p>"Lord Squander's company is desired at Lady
Townley's drum. Monday next."</p>

<p>"Lady Squander's company is desired at Miss
Hairbrain's rout."</p>

<p>"Lady Squander's company is desired at Lady
Heathen's drum-major. Sunday next."</p>

subjects so frequently painted by ancient masters:

<p class="noindent">Our exasperated Peer, suspecting his wife's infidelity,
follows her in disguise to the masquerade, and from
thence traces these two votaries of vice to a bagnio.
Finding they are retired to a bedroom, he bursts open
the door, and attacks the spoiler of his honour with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
drawn sword. Too much irritated to be prudent, and
too violent to be cautious, he thinks only of revenge;
and, making a furious thrust at the Counsellor, neglects
his own guard, and is mortally wounded. The
miscreant who had basely destroyed his peace and
deprived him of life is not bold enough to meet the
consequences. Destitute of that courage which is the
companion of virtue, and possessing no spark of that
honour which ought to distinguish the gentleman;
dreading the avenging hand of offended justice, he
makes a mean and precipitate retreat. Leaving him
to the fate which awaits him, let us return to the deluded
Countess. Feeling some pangs from a recollection
of her former conduct, some touches of shame at
her detection, and a degree of horror at the fate of
her husband, she kneels at his feet, and entreats forgiveness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Some contrite tears she shed."</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is reason to fear that they flow from regret
at the detection rather than remorse for the crime; a
woman vitiated in the vortex of dissipation is not
likely to feel that ingenuous shame which accompanies
a good mind torn by the consciousness of
having deviated from the path of virtue.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the noise occasioned by this fatal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i>,
the inmates of the brothel called a watchman:
accompanied by a constable, this nocturnal guardian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>is ushered into the room by the master of the house,
whose meagre and trembling figure is well opposed
to the consequential magistrate of the night. The
watchman's lantern we see over their heads, but the
bearer knows his duty is to follow his superiors; conscious
that though the front may be a post of honour,
yet in a service of danger the rear is a station of
safety.</p>

<p>Immediately over the door is a picture of St. Luke;
this venerable apostle being a painter, is so delineated
that he seems looking at the scene now passing, and
either making a sketch or a record of the transaction.
On the hangings is a lively representation of Solomon's
wise judgment.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The countenance of the sapient
monarch is not sagacious, but his attitude is in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
eminent degree dignified, and his air commanding
and regal. He really looks like a tyrant in old
tapestry; and the arm of a chair is ornamented by
a carving fraught with that terrific grace peculiar to
the ancient masters. We cannot say that the Hebrew
women who attend for judgment are either comely
or fair to look upon. Were not the scene laid in
Jerusalem, they might pass for two of the silver-toned
Naiades of our own Billingsgate.</p>

<p>The grisly guards have a most rueful and tremendous
appearance. The attractive portrait of a Drury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Lane Diana,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> with a butcher's steel in one hand and
a squirrel perched on the other, is hung in such a
situation that the Herculean pedestals of a Jewish
soldier may be supposed to be a delineation of her
legs continued below the frame.</p>

<p>Our Counsellor's mask lies on the floor, and grins
horribly, as if conscious of the fatal catastrophe.
Dominoes, shoes, etc., scattered around the room,
show the negligence of the ill-fated Countess, unattended
by her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i>. From a faggot
and the shadow of a pair of tongs, we may infer that
there is a fire in the room.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A bill near them implies
that this elegant apartment is at the Turk's Head

<p>The dying agony of the Earl (whose face is evidently
retouched by Hogarth), the eager entreaty of the
Countess, the terror of mine host, and the vulgar
inflected dignity of Mr. Constable, are admirably discriminated.</p>

<p>I have stated in the former editions that the background
of this plate was engraved by Ravenet's wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>but am since informed by Mr. Charles Grignion, the
engraver, that this is a mistake. See vol. iii. of this

<p class="noindent">The last sad scene of our unfortunate heroine's life is
in the house of her father, to which she had returned
after her husband's death. The law could not consider
her as the primary cause of his murder; but
consciousness of her own guilt was more severe
punishment than that could have inflicted. This,
added to her father's reproaches, and the taunts of
those who were once her friends, renders society
hateful, and solitude insupportable. Wounded in
every feeling, tortured in every nerve, and seeing no
prospect of a period to her misery, she takes the horrid
resolution of ending all her calamities by poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse4">"Dreadful deed, unbidden thus</p>
<p class="verse">To rush into the presence of her Judge,</p>
<p class="verse">And challenge vengeance. 'Tis said</p>
<p class="verse">Unheard-of tortures are reserved</p>
<p class="verse">For murderers of themselves. They herd together:</p>
<p class="verse">The common damn'd shun their society,</p>
<p class="verse">As fiends too foul for converse."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Dreadful as is this resolve, she puts it in execution
by bribing the servant of her father to procure her a
dose of laudanum. Close to the vial, which lies on
the floor, Hogarth has judiciously placed Counsellor
Silvertongue's last dying speech, thus intimating that
he also has suffered the punishment he justly merited.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The records of their fate being thus situated, seems to
imply, that as they were united in vice, they are companions
in the consequences. These two terrific and
monitory testimonies are a kind of propitiatory sacrifice
to the manes of her injured and murdered lord.</p>

<p>Her avaricious father, seeing his daughter at the
point of death, and knowing the value of her diamond
ring, determined to secure this glittering gem from
the depredations of the old nurse, coolly draws it from
her finger. This little circumstance shows a prominent
feature of his mind. Every sense of feeling
absorbed in extreme avarice, he seems at this moment
calculating how many carats the brilliants weigh.</p>

<p>From a gown hung up near the clock we know him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to be an alderman; and from his sleek appearance,
we have some right to infer that he is constant in his
attendance at city feasts, for so comely a countenance
could never be supported by the scanty and meagre
viands of his own table. His domestic care is intimated
by the gaunt and hungry appearance of a dog,
who, taking advantage of this general confusion, seizes
the brawn's head.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>A rickety child, heir to the complaints of its father,
shows some tenderness for its expiring mother; and
the grievous whine of an old nurse is most admirably
described. These are the only two of the party who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
exhibit any marks of sorrow for the death of our
wretched Countess. The smug apothecary, indeed,
displays some symptoms of vexation at his patient
dying before she has taken his julap, the label of
which hangs out of his pocket. Her constitution,
though impaired by grief, promised to have lasted
long enough for him to have marked many additional
dittos in his day-book. Pointing to the dying speech,
he threatens the terrified footboy with a punishment
similar to that of the Counsellor for having bought
the laudanum. The fellow protests his innocence,
and promises never more to be guilty of a like offence.
The effects of fear on an ignorant rustic cannot be
better delineated; nor is it easy to conceive a more
ludicrous figure than this awkward retainer, dressed
in an old full-trimmed coat, which in its better days
had been the property of his master. By the physician
retreating, we are led to conceive that, finding
his patient had dared to quit the world in an irregular
way, neither abiding by his prescriptions nor waiting
for his permission, he cast an indignant frown on all
present, and exclaimed in style heroic,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"&nbsp;'Fellow, our hat!'&mdash;no more he deign'd to say,</p>
<p class="verse">But stern as Ajax' spectre, stalk'd away."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The leathern buckets immediately over the Doctor's
head were, previous to the introduction of fire-engines,
considered as proper furniture for a merchant's hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Every ornament in his parlour is highly and exactly
appropriate to the man. The style of his pictures,
his clock, a cobweb over the window, repaired chair,
nay, the very form of his hat, are characteristic. A
silver cup upon the table, and jug on the floor, show
us his style of living. The scantiness of his own table
is well contrasted by the plenty exhibited in the
picture over the old nurse's head, where iron pots,
brass pans, cabbages, and lanterns, are indiscriminately
huddled together, with no other meaning than
to show how highly a Flemish artist could <em>finish</em>.
The <em>attic</em> delicacy of this patient and laborious
school is displayed in the adjoining picture; and
their humour, in that of a fellow wittily lighting his
tobacco-pipe by the red nose of his companion.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
pipe and bottle placed under the day-book and ledger,
and the whole crowned by a broken punch-bowl,
intimate that this venerable gentleman united business
with pleasure. The view through an open
window marks the situation of our plodding merchant's
house to be near London Bridge, and represents
that absurd and ill-contrived structure in its
original state, loaded with houses. A clock points
the hour to be a little after eleven, which at this
highly polished and refined period would be deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
an early hour for a citizen's breakfast; at that, it was
his hour of dinner!</p>

<p>Thus has our moral dramatist concluded his tragedy,
and brought his heroine from dissipation and vice to
misery and shame, terminating her existence by suicide!</p>

<p>The drama of Shakspeare has been said to be the
mirror of life, which to-day we see lighted up with
gaiety, and to-morrow clouded with sorrow. Shakspeare
had the power of exciting laughter or grief, not
only in one mind, but in one composition. That
Hogarth had the same power, and exerted it with
the same disdain of the little cavils of little minds, is
evinced in this series of prints; from the study of
which, a peasant, who has never strayed beyond the
precincts of his own cottage, may calculate the consequences
of dissipation; and he who has lived
secluded from society, may form an estimate of the
value of riches and high birth when abused by prodigality
or degraded by vice.</p>

<h3>THE FOUR STAGES OF CRUELTY.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The poorest beetle that we tread upon,</p>
<p class="verse">In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great</p>
<p class="verse">As when a giant dies."</p>
</div></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_050.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">This pathetic lesson of humanity is given by
the poet of nature. Aiming at the same
end by different means, our benevolent
artist here steps forth as the instructor of youth, the
friend to mercy, and advocate of the brute creation.</p>

<p>In the prints before us, an obdurate boy begins his
career of cruelty by tormenting animals; repeated
acts of barbarity sear his heart, he commits a deliberate
murder, and concludes in an ignominious death.
These gradations are natural, I had almost said inevitable;
and that parent who discovers the germ of
barbarity in the mind of a child, and does not use
every effort to exterminate the noxious weed, is an
accessory to the evils which spring from its baneful
growth. To check these malign propensities becomes
more necessary from the general tendency of our
amusements. Most of our rural and even infantine
sports are savage and ferocious. They arise from the
terror, misery, or death of helpless animals. A child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in the nursery is taught to impale butterflies and
cockchafers. The schoolboy's proud delight is clambering
a tree</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"To rob the poor bird of its young."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Grown a <em>gentle</em> angler, he snares the scaly fry, and
scatters leaden death among the feathered tenants of
the air. Ripened to man, he becomes a mighty
hunter, is enamoured of the chase, and crimsons his
spurs in the sides of a generous courser, whose wind
he breaks in the pursuit of an inoffensive deer or
timid hare.</p>

<p>Many of our town diversions have the same
tendency. The bird, whose melodious warblings
echo through the grove, is imprisoned in a sort of a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bastille</i>, where, like an unplumed biped in a similar
situation, it frequently perishes through anguish or
want of food. The high-crested chanticleer, whose
courage is innate, and only vanquished by death, is
furnished with weapons of pointed steel, when, set in
opposition to one of the same species, armed in a
similar style, these two champions, for the diversion
of the <em>humane</em> lords of the creation, lacerate each
other until one or both of them are slain.</p>

<p>The faithful dog, whose attachment and gratitude
are exemplary, and worthy the imitation of man,
when in the possession of a farmer, or country 'squire,
is well fed, and has no great cause of complaint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
except his ears and tail being lopped to <em>improve
nature</em>, and having a rib now and then broken by a
gentle spurn; but if the poor quadruped falls into
the hands of a tanner, a surgeon, or an <em>experimental</em>
philosopher, of what avail are his good qualities?<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Abyssinian cruelties of our slaughter-houses<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and kitchens<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I do not wish to enumerate. The
catalogue would fill a volume. Humanity demands
that the brute creation should be protected by the
Legislature.</p>

<p>The Mosaic Law, to guard against tortures being
inflicted on animals which were slaughtered for
sustenance, ordained them to die by a highly polished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>and pointed instrument; if the bone was pierced,
or the beast mangled, it was deemed unclean, and
burnt.</p>

<p class="noindent">Let us suppose a disciple of Pythagoras to contemplate
this print, how would it affect him? He would
imagine it to represent a group of young barbarians
qualifying themselves for executioners; would raise
his voice to Heaven, and thank the God of mercy
that he is not an inhabitant of such a country; would
lament that these degenerate little beings should not
have been informed that the animals on whom they are
now inflicting such tortures, might, previous to transmigration,
have been their fathers, brothers, friends.</p>

<p>The delineation of such scenes must shock every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
feeling heart, and their enumeration disgust every
humane mind. I hope, for the honour of our nature
and our nation, that they are not so frequently practised
as when these prints were published.</p>

<p>The hero of this tragic tale is Tom Nero: by a
badge upon his arm, we know him to be one of the
boys of St. Giles' Charity School. The horrible
business in which he is engaged was, I hope and
believe, never realized in this or any other country.
The thought is taken from Callot's "Temptation of
St. Anthony." A youth of superior rank, shocked at
such cruelty, offers his tart to redeem the dog from
torture. This Hogarth intended for the portrait of
an illustrious personage, then about thirteen years
of age; the compliment was rather coarse, but well
intended. A lad chalking on a wall the suspended
figure, inscribed <span class="smcap">Tom Nero</span>, prepares us for the
future fate of this young tyrant, and shows by anticipation
the reward of cruelty.</p>

<p>Throwing at cocks might possibly have its origin in
what some of our sagacious politicians call a natural
enmity to France, which is thus <em>humanely</em> exercised
against the allegorical symbol of that nation. A boy
tying a bone to the tail of his dog, while the kind-hearted
animal licks his hand, must have a most
diabolical disposition.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Two little imps are burning

group of embryotic Domitians, who have tied two
cats to the extremities of a rope and hung it over a
lamp-iron, to see how <em>delightfully</em> they will tear each
other, are marked with grim delight. The link-boy
is absolutely a Lilliputian fiend. The fellow encouraging
a dog to worry a cat, and two animals of
the same species thrown out of a garret window
with bladders fastened to them, completes this mortifying
prospect of youthful depravity.</p>

his disposition in his conduct to a horse. Worn
out by ill-usage, and exhausted by fatigue, the poor
animal has fallen down, overset the carriage, and
broken his leg. The scene is laid at Thavie's Inn
gate:<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> four brethren of the brawling bar, who have

<p>Parts of this print may at first sight appear rather
overcharged, but some recent examples convince us
that they are not so. In the year 1790, a fellow was
convicted of lacerating and tearing out the tongue of
a horse; but there being no evidence of his bearing
any malice towards the proprietor, or doing it with a
view of injuring <em>him</em>, this diabolical wretch, not having
violated any then existing statute, was discharged
without punishment.</p>

<p>The hero of this print began by torturing a helpless
dog; he then beat out the eye of an unoffending
horse; and now, under the influence of that malignant
rancorous spirit, which by indulgence is become
natural, he commits murder&mdash;most foul and aggravated
murder!&mdash;for this poor deluded girl is pregnant
by the wretch who deprives her of life. He tempts
her to quit a happy situation; to plunder an indulgent
mistress, and meet him with the produce of her
robbery. Blinded by affection, she keeps the fatal
appointment, and comes loaded with plate. This
remorseless villain, having previously determined to
destroy her, and by that means cancel his promise of
marriage, free himself from an expected encumbrance,
and silence one whom compunction might at a future
day induce to confess the crime and lead to his detection,
puts her to death!</p>

<p>This atrocious act must have been perpetrated with
most savage barbarity, for the head is nearly severed,
and the wrist cut almost through. Her cries are
heard by the servants of a neighbouring house, who
run to her assistance. 'Tis too late. The horrid deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>

<p>By the pistol in his pocket and watches on the

the earlier part of the evening. The time is what
has been emphatically called "the witching hour!"&mdash;the
iron tongue of midnight has told <span class="fs80">ONE</span>!</p>

<p>The letter found in his pocket gives a history of the

<p class="noindent">The savage and diabolical progress of cruelty is now
ended, and the thread of life severed by the sword of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
justice. From the place of execution the murderer is
brought to Surgeons' Hall, and now represented under
the knife of a dissector. This venerable person, as
well as his coadjutor, who scoops out the criminal's
eye, and a young student scarifying the leg, seem to
have just as much feeling as the subject now under
their inspection.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> A frequent contemplation of sanguinary
scenes hardens the heart, deadens sensibility,
and destroys every tender sensation.</p>

<p>Our legislators, considering how unfit such men are
to determine in cases of life and death, have judiciously
excluded both surgeons and butchers from
serving upon juries.</p>

<p>Hogarth was most peculiarly accurate in those little
markings which identify. The gunpowder initials T.
N. on the arm, denote this to be the body of Thomas
Nero. The face being impressed with horror has been
objected to. It must be acknowledged that this is
rather "o'er-stepping the modesty of nature;" but he
so rarely deviates from her laws, that a little poetical
licence may be forgiven where it produces humour or
heightens character.</p>

<p>The skeletons on each side of the print are inscribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>"James Field" (an eminent pugilist), and
"Maclean" (a notorious robber). Both of these
worthies died by a rope. They are pointing to the
physician's crest which is carved on the upper part of
the president's<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> chair, viz. a hand feeling a pulse;
taking a guinea would have been more appropriate to
the practice. The heads of these two heroes of the
halter are turned so as to seem ridiculing the president,
"Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp."
Every countenance in this grisly band is marked with
that medical importance which dignifies the professors.
Some of them we discover to be "from Caledonia's
bleak and barren clime."</p>

<p>A fellow depositing the intestines in a pail, and a
dog licking the murderer's heart, are disgusting and
nauseous objects. The vessel where the skulls and
bones bubble-bubble, gives some idea of the infernal
caldron of Hecate.</p>

<p>Of this print, and that preceding it, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
wooden blocks engraved upon a large scale, invented
and published by "William Hogarth, Jan. 1, 1750; J.
Bell, sculpt." They were executed by order of Mr.
Hogarth, who wished to circulate the salutary examples
they contain, by making the price low enough
for a poor man's purse; but finding engraving on
wood much more expensive than he had calculated,
he altered his plan, and engraved them on copper.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">Fully impressed with the truth of this
axiom, Mr. Hogarth engraved the two following
prints, in which he has considered
porter as the liquor natural to an English constitution;
and that villanous distillation, gin, as pernicious
and poisonous. While that noble beverage properly
termed British Burgundy<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> refreshes the weary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
exhilarates the faint, and cheers the depressed, an
infernal compound of juniper and fiery spirits debases
the mind, destroys the constitution, and brings its
thirsty votaries to an untimely grave.</p>

<p>These, as well as the four preceding prints, are
calculated for the lower orders of society, and exhibit
such a contrast as must strike the most careless observer.
In the first, we see healthy and happy beings
inhaling copious draughts of a liquor which seems
perfectly congenial to their mental and corporeal
powers; in the second, a group of emaciated wretches
who, by swallowing liquid fire, have consumed both.</p>

in his most happy moments. In the left corner, a
butcher and a blacksmith are each of them grasping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>a foaming tankard of porter. By the <cite>King's Speech</cite>
and the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite> upon the table before them,
they appear to have been studying politics, and
settling the state of the nation. The blacksmith
having just purchased a shoulder of mutton, is triumphantly
waving it in the air. Next to him a
drayman is whispering soft sentences of love to a
servant-maid, round whose neck is one of his arms;
in the other hand a pot of porter. Two fish-women,
furnished with a flagon of the same liquor, are chaunting
a song of Mr. Lockman's<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> on the British Herring

cup. In a garret window a trio of sailors are employed
in the same way; and on a house-top are four
bricklayers equally joyous. Each of these groups
seem hale, happy, and well clothed; but the artist,
who is painting a glass bottle from an original which

<p class="noindent">From contemplating the health, happiness, and
mirth flowing from a moderate use of a wholesome
and natural beverage, we turn to this nauseous contrast,
which displays human nature in its most
degraded and disgusting state. The retailer of gin
and ballads,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who sits upon the steps with a bottle in
one hand and a glass in the other, is horribly fine.
Having bartered away his waistcoat, shirt, and stockings,
and drank until he is in a state of total insensibility;
pale, wan, and emaciated, he is a perfect
skeleton. A few steps higher is a debased counterpart
of Lazarus, taking snuff; thoroughly intoxicated, and
negligent of the infant at her breast, it falls over the
rail into an area, and dies an innocent victim to the
baneful vice of its depraved parent. Another of the
fair sex has drank herself to sleep. As an emblem
of her disposition being slothful, a snail is crawling
from the wall to her arm. Close to her we discover
one of the lords of the creation gnawing a bare bone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which a bull-dog, equally ravenous, endeavours to
snatch from his mouth. A working carpenter is
depositing his coat and saw with a pawnbroker. A
tattered female offers her culinary utensils at the
same shrine: among them we discover a tea-kettle
pawned to procure money to purchase gin.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> An old
woman, having drank until she is unable to walk,
is put into a wheel-barrow, and in that situation a
lad solaces her with another glass. With the same
poisonous and destructive compound, a mother in the
corner drenches her child. Near her are two charity-girls
of St. Giles', pledging each other in the same
corroding compound. The scene is completed by a
quarrel between two drunken mendicants, both of
whom appear in the character of cripples. While one
of them uses his crutch as a quarterstaff, the other
with great goodwill aims a stool, on which he usually
sat, at the head of his adversary. This, with a crowd
waiting for their drams at a distiller's door, completes
the catalogue of the <em>quick</em>. Of the <em>dead</em> there are
two, besides an unfortunate child whom a drunken
madman has impaled upon a spit.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> One a barber,
who, having probably drank gin until he has lost his
reason, has suspended himself by a rope in his own
ruinous garret; the other a beautiful woman, whom by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>direction of the parish beadle two men are depositing
in a shell. From her wasted and emaciated appearance,
we may fairly infer she also fell a martyr to
this destructive and poisonous liquid. On the side of
her coffin is a child lamenting the loss of its parent.</p>

<p>The large pewter measure hung over a cellar, on
which is engraved "Gin Royal," was once a common
sign; the inscription on this cave of despair, "Drunk
for a penny, dead drunk for twopence, clean straw
for nothing," is worthy observation; it exhibits the
state of our metropolis at that period.</p>

<p>The scene of this horrible devastation is laid in a
place which was a few years since properly enough
called the Ruins of St. Giles'.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Except the pawnbroker's,
distiller's, and undertaker's, the houses are
literally ruins! These doorkeepers to Famine, Disease,
and Death, living by the calamities of others, are
in a flourishing state.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hogarth seems to have received the first idea
of these two prints from a pair by Peter Breughel
(frequently called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Breughel d'enfer</i>), which exhibit a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>similar contrast. In the one entitled "La Grosse" are
a number of comely and well-fed personages; in the
other, which is baptized "La Maigre Cuisine," the
characters are meagre and wasted: seated on a straw
mat are a mother and child, which very much resemble
the wretched female we see upon the steps in the print
under consideration.</p>

<p>To the perspective little attention is paid, but the
characters are admirably discriminated. The emaciated
retailer of gin is well drawn. The woman
with a snuff-box has all the mawkish marks of debasement
and drunkenness. The man gnawing a
bone, a dog tearing it from him, and the pawnbroker,
have countenances in an equal degree hungry and
rapacious.</p>

<p>A print entitled the "Gin Drinkers," which bears
strong marks of being one of Hogarth's early productions,
may perhaps have been the first thought on
which this print was built.</p>

<p>On the subject of these plates was published a
catchpenny compilation from Reynolds' "God's Revenge
against Murder," entitled "<cite>A Dissertation on
Mr. Hogarth's six prints&mdash;'Gin Lane,' 'Beer Street,'

</div>

<p class="drop-capx">For the etchings of Rembrandt, and a herd of
servile imitators who, without any of his
genius, copied his defects, Hogarth had the
most sovereign contempt. He considered their productions
as unmeaning scratches, as dingy and violent
combinations of light and darkness, which would not
bear to be tried by the criterion of either nature or
art. How far he was right in his opinion is not my
inquiry; but certain it is, that at the time of this
publication they had the sanction of those who were
deemed good judges, and produced most enormous
prices. To correct this vitiated taste, and bring men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
back to reason and common sense, our whimsical
artist etched this very grotesque print.</p>

<p>The Apostle, conformable to the general practice
of the Flemish school, is represented as a mean and
vulgar character. Among the Lilliputians he might
have been a giant; among the Romans he must have
been a dwarf. In the true spirit of Dutch allegory,
a figure fat enough for a burgomaster, invested with
wings "that clad each shoulder broad," is seated on
the floor behind him as a guardian angel. At this
unpropitious moment the guardian angel is asleep,
and a little imp of darkness,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> ever active in mischief,
is busily employed with a hand-saw cutting through
the leg of the Apostle's stool, which falling, must inevitably
bring the orator to the ground, where he will
probably be seized by the snarling dog on whose
collar is engraved "Felix," and who seems to have
an eye to the saint, though his nose is evidently
pointed at his appalled master. Seated in a wicker
chair, with the Roman eagle over his head, and the
fasces at his left hand, Felix indeed trembles. On
an adjoining seat is the all-accomplished Drusilla
and her lap-dog. Her olfactory nerves, as well as
those of her companion, are violently affected. With
a sacrificing knife in his right hand, his left clenched,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>and a countenance irritated almost to madness, the
High Priest appears ready to leap from the bench and
put the Apostle to death, but is prevented by a more
prudent senator. The audience are worthy of the
judges; male and female, young and old, are in dress,
deportment, and feature, perfectly Dutch. Of the
same school is the statue of Justice, with a bandage
over one eye, and grasping, in the place of a flaming
sword, a butcher's knife.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> She stands in awful state,
laden with bags of gold, the rewards of legal decisions.</p>

<p>At a table beneath the bench are five curious
characters. The first, maugre the thundering eloquence
of St. Paul, is asleep; the next, mending a
pen; two adjoining are highly offended with a noxious
effluvia, while their bearded associate is grinning and
pointing at the cause from which it emanates. Regardless
of all other objects, an Hebrew counterpart
of Shylock is expanding his hands in astonishment
at the unguarded vehemence of the preacher. Not
less exasperated is Tertullus, who, arrayed in the habit
of an English serjeant-at-law,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> has nothing Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>but his nose. Boiling with rage, and irritated almost
to madness, he tears his brief: this, a devil, who to
give him peculiar distinction has three horns, is carefully
picking up and joining the remnants together.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The vase, and silver plates in a recess, the violent
stream of light which dazzles the eyes of a priest
<em>who stands with his back to it</em>, the boat, bark, and
white sail glittering in the wave, and a village and
windmill in the distance, are all of Rembrandt's
school.</p>

<p>The plate was originally intended as a receipt-ticket
to the large "Paul before Felix," and "Pharaoh's
Daughter;" and the artist stained many early impressions
with that yellow tint which time gives to old
prints. For the Paul, and Moses, he afterwards engraved
another design, and presented this to any of
his friends who requested it; but finding applications
increase, he fixed the price at five shillings.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="caption">PAUL PREACHING BEFORE FELIX.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This print Mr. Hogarth intended as a serious and
sublime representation of the scene which he had so
inimitably burlesqued; yet so little are we qualified
to judge of our own powers, that he has here produced
a print as destitute of elevation and sentiment as are
the works of those masters he so successfully ridiculed.
With the Roman eagle he could not soar, and
has drawn the royal bird like a sparrow-hawk, nailed
to the bottom of a writing-desk. The Apostle, with
his right foot resting on a lower step than the left,
has neither grace, dignity, nor firmness. Felix has
the appearance of a vinegar-faced apothecary feeling
the pulse of a nervous female patient, and shocked at
the velocity of our circulation, dropping the prescription
from his left hand. The haughty High Priest
biting his nails, is deficient in everything except his
drapery: the Jew immediately behind him bears a
strong resemblance to an old-clothes-man. The
standard-bearer, and woman with her hands closed,
are a degree better; but the Herculean advocate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
with a brief in his right hand, looks like a journeyman
hatter that has drank porter till he is drowsy; by
the strength of his muscles and the stupidity of his
countenance, he seems better fitted for a bruiser than
a pleader.</p>

<p>The listening soldier, at the opposite corner, is
meanly conceived and ill drawn.</p>

<p>At the bottom of one of the copies I once saw the
following memorandum in the handwriting of Hogarth:
"A print of the plate that was set aside as insufficient.
Engraved by W. H."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This is engraved from the same design as the former,
but the situation of the figures is reversed, and
Drusilla omitted, it being thought that St. Paul's
hand was rather improperly placed.</p>

<p>It is somewhat superior to the former, but the light
is ill distributed, and the characters too individual for
the dignity of historical composition.</p>

<p>Upon this and the following print Doctor Joseph
Warton, in his <cite>Essay on the Genius and Writings of
Pope</cite>, made the following remark. Trusting to his
memory, he confounded two prints together, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>remembering to have seen a dog snarling at a cat in
the fourth print of "Industry and Idleness," from an
error in recollection, transferred them to the "Paul
before Felix:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some nicer virtuosi have remarked, that in the
serious pieces into which Hogarth has deviated from
the natural bias of his genius there are some strokes
of the ridiculous discernible, which suit not with the
dignity of his subject. In his Preaching of St. Paul, a
dog snarling at a cat; and in his Pharaoh's Daughter,
the figure of the infant Moses, who expresses rather
archness than timidity, are alleged as instances that
this artist, unrivalled in his walk, could not resist the
impulse of his imagination towards drollery. His
picture, however, of Richard <span class="fs80">III.</span> is pure and unmixed,
without any ridiculous circumstances, and strongly
impresses terror and amazement."</p>

<p>On the publication of this criticism, Hogarth engraved
the whole quotation under the two prints
alluded to without any comment; but on the appearance
of the following very ample and candid
apology, erased them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The author gladly lays hold of the opportunity
of this third edition of his work to confess a mistake
he had committed with respect to two admirable
paintings of Mr. Hogarth,&mdash;his Paul Preaching, and
his Infant Moses,&mdash;which on a closer examination are
not chargeable with the blemishes imputed to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Justice obliges him to declare the high opinion he
entertains of the abilities of this inimitable artist, who
shines in so many different lights and on such very
dissimilar subjects, and whose works have more of
what the ancients called the <span title="ÊThOS">ΗΘΟΣ</span> in them than the
compositions of any other modern. For the rest, the
author begs leave to add, that he is so far from being
ashamed of retracting his error, that he had rather
appear a man of candour than the best critic that
ever lived."</p>

<p>Hogarth did not understand Greek, and was for
some time doubtful whether the <span title="ÊThOS">ΗΘΟΣ</span> was meant as
complimentary or satirical.</p>

<p>If the original painting in Lincoln's-Inn Hall were
destroyed, Hogarth's reputation would not be diminished.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">Among the many benevolent institutions
which do honour to this nation, the hospital
for maintaining exposed and deserted
infants may be ranked as one of the most humane
and political. Let the austere enthusiast censure it
as an encouragement to vice, and the rigid moralist
declaim against giving sanction to profligacy, it is still
an useful and a benevolent foundation.</p>

<p>To protect the helpless, give refuge to the innocent,
and render that unoffending being a useful member
of society whose parents may be too indigent to give
it proper sustenance, or wicked enough to destroy it,
is fulfilling one great precept of religion, and must
afford a pure and exalted gratification to every
philanthropic mind.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>That it is found necessary to restrict the plan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
confine the charity in such narrow limits, is much to
be lamented. Compassion and policy demand that
the doors should be open to every proper object.</p>

<p>To this asylum for deserted infancy Mr. Hogarth
was one of the earliest benefactors,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and to their
institution presented the picture from which this print
is engraved; there is not perhaps in holy writ another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>story so exactly suitable to the avowed purpose of
the foundation.</p>

<p>The history of Moses being deserted by his mother,
exposed among the bulrushes, and discovered and
protected by the daughter of Pharaoh, is known to
every one who has read the Bible: those who have
not, may find it there recorded, with many other
things well worthy their attention. At the point of
time here taken, the child's mother, whom the Princess
considers as merely its nurse, has brought him to his
patroness, and is receiving from the treasurer the
wages of her services. The little foundling naturally
clings to his nurse, though invited to leave her by the
daughter of a monarch. The eyes of an attendant,
and a whispering Ethiopian, convey an oblique suspicion
that the child has a nearer affinity to their
mistress than she chooses to acknowledge.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Considered as a whole, this picture has a more
historic air than we often find in the works of Hogarth.
The royal Egyptian is graceful, and in some degree
elevated.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The treasurer is marked with austere
dignity, and the Jewess and child with nature. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>scene is superb, and the distant prospect of pyramids,
etc. highly picturesque and appropriate to the country.
To exhibit this scene, the artist has placed the
groups at such a distance as crowd the corners and
leave the centre unoccupied. As the Greeks are said
to have received the rudiments of art from Egypt,
the line of beauty on the base of a pillar is properly
introduced. A crocodile creeping from under the
stately chair may be intended to mark the neighbourhood
of the Nile, but is a poor and forced conceit.</p>

<h3>FOUR PRINTS OF AN ELECTION.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_085.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I think it is Voltaire who observes that the
English nation are mad every seven years:
he might have added that there are local
fits which seize some parts of the country at other
times; but this madness, like the fermentation of
liquors, proves the spirit of the people.</p>

<p>In the following series of prints Mr. Hogarth has
delineated the progress of this malady, in four of its
most remarkable stages, with that broad and characteristic
humour peculiar to himself. He has presented
us with the mirror of a contested election, the British
Saturnalia; in which is displayed what Abbé Raynal
most emphatically calls "the majesty of the people!"&mdash;an
expression, says the same writer, "which would
alone consecrate a language."</p>

<p>The first print was published February 24, 1755,
and inscribed to the Right Hon. Henry Fox.&mdash;Plate
II., February 20, 1757, to Sir Charles Hanbury Williams,
Ambassador to the Court of Russia.&mdash;Plate
III., February 20, 1758, to the Hon. Sir Edward
Walpole, Knight of the Bath.&mdash;Plate IV., January 1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
1759, to the Hon. George Hay, one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>The original pictures are now in the possession of
Mrs. Garrick, at Hampton.</p>

<p>It appears from the <cite>Grub Street Journal</cite> of June
13, 1734, that the same subject had been previously
attempted by another artist, under the title of "The
Humours of a Country Election." It must be acknowledged
that the inscriptions to some of the compartments
have a striking similarity to the scenes
represented by Hogarth. "The candidates very
complaisant to a country clown," etc. "The candidates
making an entertainment for the electors and
their wives; at the upper end of the table the parson
of the parish," etc.</p>

<p>In 1759 was published, in four cantos, a poetical
description of these prints, introduced by the following
remarkable advertisement, dated</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Cheapside</span>, <em>March 1, 1759</em>.</p>

<p>"For the satisfaction of the reader, and in justice to
the concealed author, I take the liberty, with the permission
of Mr. Hogarth, to insert in this manner that
gentleman's opinion of the following cantos, which is&mdash;That
the thoughts entirely coincide with his own;
that there is a well-adapted vein of humour preserved
through the whole; and that though some of his
works have been formerly explained by other hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
yet none ever gave him so much satisfaction as the
present performance.</p>

<p class="right smcap">"John Smith."</p>
</div>

<p>Had Mr. Hogarth's taste for poetry been in any
degree equal to his skill in painting, he would scarcely
have given so strong a sanction to this wretched attempt
at Hudibrastic humour, which is coarse, dull,
mean, and very unworthy of the scenes which it professes
to celebrate.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

every other business.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The scene is laid in a
country town, at an inn, which in these piping times
of peace is kept open for the friends of the Court
candidate. All the party, except the divine and the
mayor, have ended their repast; but episcopal dignity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>or prætorian distinction, gives a right to more indulgence
than is allowed to the unhallowed multitude.</p>

<p>The highly polished and accomplished gentleman<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
who aspires to the honour of a seat in the British
senate demands our first notice. He has what an
Hibernian would call a face of much promise. His
dress, air, and grace proclaim that he has travelled.
Pope has described him exactly as if he had sat for
the picture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p>At this time of general equality and universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
levelling, when knight and vassal, esquire and mechanic,
are of equal rank, our paragon of politeness is
lending an attentive ear to a disgusting old beldam,
who from her rotundity may be a descendant of Sir
John Falstaff's. In her hand, which is behind him,
she holds a letter directed to Sir Commodity Taxem;
this we may naturally suppose contains either a
request of a favour or an offer of a service, in the sure
and certain hope of a return to it. Be that as it may,
the gallant knight shows her every attention, and has
stretched his long arm half round her ample waist:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Thus the bold eagle leaves his azure way,</p>
<p class="verse">And takes the carrion carcase for his prey;</p>
<p class="verse">There dips his beak&mdash;but when the banquet's done,</p>
<p class="verse">Replumes his wings, and rises to the sun."</p>
</div></div>

<p>While a little girl dazzled with the splendour of his
brilliant ring attempts to make it a prize, a fellow
who stands upon a chair behind him, with all that
easy familiarity which the time warrants, strikes the
Baronet's head against that of the old woman, and
shakes the ashes out of his tobacco-pipe upon his
powdered hair. This is election wit.</p>

<p>The next group form a trio, and are made up by a
grinning cobbler, a dirty-faced barber, and a mawkish
gentleman, whose hand the son of St. Crispin grasps
with an energy that almost cracks the bones. The
barber, equally friendly, pinches his arm, and resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
one hand upon his shoulder blows the hot fumes from
a short tobacco-pipe into his eye. This also is
election wit.</p>

<p>A pyramidical group behind is composed of an
officer, a drunken counsellor, and a pleasing young
woman, over whose head the maudlin advocate,
flourishing a bumper of wine, roars out an obscene
toast. This is the third and most finished specimen
of election wit. At a table a little beneath, stewing
"the last lov'd remnant of the forest haunch," sits an
oily divine,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> holding his canonical periwig in his
right hand, and wiping his forehead with the left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Behind him is a Scotch bagpiper, who, at the same
time that he is pressing out his harsh and unmusical
tones, enjoys the <em>royal</em> luxury of scratching.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> A
female player on the violin,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and a most consequential
performer on the bass viol, when aided by the Caledonian
pipe, must form a most melodious concert.</p>

<p>A fourth votary of St. Cecilia holds his musical instrument
under his arm, ceasing all dulcet sounds,
while he drinks a glass of Burgundy with a gentleman
who seems much gratified at seeing a chin of more
extravagant length than his own. Adjoining are two
country fellows delighted beyond measure at a person<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
making the representation of a face by wrapping
a napkin round his hand, and singing, "An old woman
clothed in grey," etc. This face, ingeniously designed
with charcoal blots for eyes and mouth, bears a
strong resemblance to the poor gouty old fellow on
his left hand, whose violent contortions lead us to
suspect that he feels some disagreeable internal
emotion. Behind, is a fellow pouring the contents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>a vessel through a window amongst a crowd made up
of the opposite party, in return for a shower of stones
they are hurling into the room. To annoy and repel
these troublesome assailants, a man at the opposite
corner throws out a three-legged stool. At the upper
end of the table sits a gentleman in a tye-wig, whom
we presume to be the Right Worshipful Mr. Mayor.
He has ate oysters until his breath is stopped, and
is now under the hands of a barber-surgeon. This
village <em>Sangrado</em> attempts to breathe a vein; "But
ah! the purple tide no more will flow."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this suspension of vital powers,
our absolute monarch of his own corporation, true to
the cause, and actuated by his ruling passion, even in
death, grasps a fork, on which he has impaled an
oyster. Immediately behind him an electioneering
agent offers a bribe to a puritanic tailor; but this
conscientious wielder of the needle, lifting up his eyes
with horror, refuses the money, maugre the terrific
threats of his <em>amiable</em> wife, who, while she raises her
right fist in a menacing style, rests her left hand on
the head of their barefooted boy.</p>

<p>On an opposite chair is an unfortunate man of the
law, who, intent on casting up the sure and doubtful
votes, is, like the mighty Goliah, struck in the forehead
with a stone, and falls prostrate to the floor.
"Where be his quirks and quiddits now?"</p>

<p>A champion of the same party, generally called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
bludgeon-man,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> having met with a similar accident
in the cause of his country, is taken in hand by a
patriotic butcher, who, assuming the office of surgeon,
pours gin into the wound. A little boy filling a
mashing-tub with punch,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and a trading Quaker reading
a promissory note, conclude the catalogue. This
note is from the candidate to Mr. Abel Squat for
fifty pounds, payable six months after date, and
probably offered in payment for ribands, gloves, etc.,
which are to be presented to the electors' wives and
daughters. With this note honest Abel is much
dissatisfied; and by the manner one hand is laid upon
his little bale of goods, it does not seem probable that
he will part with them for paper security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming in at the door we see a band of assailants
from the opposite party, determined to attack the
enemy in their entrenchments; most of them flourish
their cudgels, but one of the heroes brandishes a
sword. The stag's horns over the door may perhaps
be intended to convey some allusion to the trembling
Puritan. A party, whom their enemies at that time
distinguished by the name of Jacobites, to show <em>their</em>
respect for Revolution principles, have mangled the
portrait of King William the Third. The escutcheon
with the Elector's arms, <span class="fs80">A CHEVRON SABLE BETWEEN
THREE GUINEAS OR</span>, with the crest of a gaping mouth,
and motto "Speak and Have," is very applicable to a
parliamentary canvas. The landscape over the candidate's
head may, it has been observed, be intended
as a representation of the town where this business
is transacting. On the flag, which is entwined with
laurels, is inscribed "Liberty and Loyalty," which
cabalistic words, like the Abracadabra, are a sort of
charm to the eyes of your Englishman. On another
flag, which lies upon the ground, is written, "Give
us our Eleven Days."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In the tobacco tray is a paper
of Kirton's best,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and a slip from the Act against

A lobster appears to be creeping towards a mutton
chop, which lies unheeded in a corner. A procession
in the street are following an effigy,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> on the breast
of which is inscribed, "No Jews." The mottoes on
their flags are equally curious: "Liberty and Property,
and no Excise;" and, "Marry and Multiply,
in spite of the devil."</p>

<p>An inscription on the butcher's cockade is infinitely
more classical and elegant: "Pro Patriæ" has a chance
of general admiration, because it is not generally
understood.</p>

<p>As to the characters of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>.
The face and air of the Baronet are perfectly of
Lord Chesterfield's school; a fellow scattering
ashes on his head, and the cobbler at the table,
are marked with mischief. The fat old woman is
of Mother Cole's family; and the divine has the
corpulence and consequence of a bishop. He must
"lard the lean earth as he walks along." The two
country fellows looking with delighted eyes at Mr.
Parnell, and an old man tortured by the gout, are
admirably discriminated. The barber-surgeon and
his brother butcher have so much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i>, and
display so little feeling for their suffering patients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that we naturally infer each of them is in great
practice.</p>

<p>Hogarth was fond of making experiments; and
it has been said, that when engraving this plate he
determined to attempt what no artist had ever performed,
<em>i.e.</em> to finish the plate without taking a single
proof during the process. The consequence was such
as might be expected; he made some mistakes that
it was scarcely possible to rectify, and on discovering
the errors, violently exclaimed that he was ruined.
On his passion subsiding, a brother engraver assisted
him to correct the faults occasioned by trying to
perform an impossibility. It is, however, the highest
finished print he ever engraved.</p>

<p>In the first state of the plate were some lemons
and oranges lying on a paper by the side of the tub;
but Hogarth being informed that vitriol and cream
of tartar are the usual acids in election punch, erased
them from the copper.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The centre group in this print represents a rustic
freeholder between two innkeepers, each of whom,
as agents for their respective parties, are dropping
money into his hands. From the arch and significant
cast of his eye, we see that though interest induces
him to take all that either of them will give, <em>conscience</em>
obliges him to vote for the best paymaster.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
One of the candidates, considering how necessary it
is to conciliate the favour of the fair, is purchasing
trinkets from a Jew pedlar for two ladies, who express
their virtuous wishes in a balcony. Though neither
of them have votes, their interest may be very extensive.
By the direction upon a letter which a porter,
in the hope of a more liberal gratuity, delivers with a
bended knee, we perceive that this gentleman is of
the numerous and ancient family of the party tools,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>who have flourished in this island ever since the
Revolution. A packet on the ground consists of
printed bills to be dispersed among the electors, intimating
that Punch's theatre is opened,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> the company
of the worthy electors humbly<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and earnestly requested,
etc. etc. In election business, eating is a
leading article; of this, two hungry countrymen in
the Royal Oak larder seem perfectly sensible. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>of them is voraciously devouring a fowl, and the other
slashing away a round of beef. Seated upon an old
stern of a ship, which is placed as a kind of national
trophy at the inn door, and represents the British lion
swallowing the lily of France, is the buxom landlady
(at this time a very important personage), counting
the money she has received for <em>her</em> interest in the
borough; a grenadier watches her with that kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
eagerness which seems to intimate a desire of dividing
the spoil. Settling the nation while they drink their
ale, a barber and a cobbler are engaged in a dispute
upon politics at the door of the Portobello<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> alehouse.
The former seems describing, with pieces of broken
tobacco-pipes, the great exploits of Admiral Vernon
with six ships only. In the progress of this voluble
harangue he has advanced something contrary to the
cobbler's creed, and Crispin, being no great orator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
offers to back his opinion by a wager. This the
eloquent flourisher of a razor is either unwilling or
unable to answer, and the self-important mender of
bad soles triumphantly sweeps his cash from the table
to his pocket. A fellow mounted on a cross-beam at
the end of the Crown signpost deserves particular
notice. Eagerly exercising his hand-saw, he strains
every nerve to cut through the beam, totally negligent
of his own situation, and forgetting that when
the Crown drops&mdash;he must fall. To accelerate this
operation, and bring the business to a more speedy
crisis, two zealous coadjutors are exerting all their
strength in pulling at a rope which is tied round the
beam. This is one of the neatest pieces of allegory
that Hogarth has delineated.</p>

<p>The crowd beneath are a fair representation of what
we had occasion to notice before&mdash;the majesty of the
people. Delighting in devastation, and blind to its
consequences, they with one voice "cry havoc, and
let slip the dogs of war." The landlord, enraged at
this wanton attack upon his <em>castle</em>, opens his window
and discharges a blunderbuss amongst the assailants.
Painted on the upper part of a show-cloth, and hung
before the sign of the Royal Oak,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> is a view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Treasury, out of which a stream of gold is poured into
a bag, which, when filled, will be hoisted into a large
waggon now loading with guineas to defray the expense
of the approaching elections. Next to this is a
view of that <em>solid</em> specimen of Mr. Ware's taste and
talents in architecture, the Horse Guards. To the
cupola of this ponderous pile the artist has, with
very little exaggeration, given the form of a beer
barrel. In the centre arch the builder forgot proportion
and neglected utility, so that the state coach
could not pass through until the ground was lowered.
To satirize this violation of the laws of Palladio, and
inattention to the dictates of common sense, Hogarth
has represented the royal carriage on the point of
entering the arch, and the king's <em>body-coachman</em> without
a head.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Beneath is delineated that ancient
favourite of a puppet-show, the facetious Mr. Punch,
with a barrow full of guineas, which, with a wooden
ladle, he tosses up and scatters in the air, to the
great delight of two sylvan freeholders who attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to catch them in their hats. One of these <em>simple</em>
swains,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> having had his head broken with the gold,
endeavours to guard his <em>caput</em> from future mishaps.
An old woman standing behind them with a magic
wand, I suppose to be Mrs. Punch. Underneath is a
very applicable inscription, "Punch, a candidate for
Guzzledown." A view in the background, between
the Crown and Portobello, of a cottage embosomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in a wood, and a village in the distance, is highly
picturesque. The tree, which spreads its foliage
before the walls of the Royal Oak, has one withered
bough; and enveloped by the luxuriant branches of
a vine, hangs a wooden bunch of grapes.</p>

<p>The characters are admirable. Nothing can be
superior to the haughty and oracular self-importance
of the cobbler; the barber has all his professional
volubility; and the leer of the countryman lets you
into his whole soul. It is evidently directed to mine
host of the Oak,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> who, added to his superior weight
of <em>metal</em>, has a superior weight of body, and a much
more persuasive aspect. The Jew has the true countenance
of his tribe. Of his customer, we may say in
the language of Shylock,</p>

the feelings of his opponent, who, rubbing his head
with every mark of apprehensive agitation, contemplates
the state of the poll, and shudders at the heavy
expense of a contest in which he is likely to be the
loser. Such are the cares of a candidate.</p>

<p>The first person that tenders his oath to the swearing
clerk is an old soldier, and probably a brave one,
for he has lost a leg, an arm, and a hand, in the
service of his country. They were severed by the
sword of an enemy, but the trunk and heart remain
entire, and are entitled to more respect than is paid
them by the brawling advocate, who, with that loud
and overbearing loquacity for which Billingsgate and
the bar are so deservedly eminent, puts in a protest
against his vote. The objection is not founded upon
this heroic remnant of war having forfeited his franchise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
by any improper conduct, but upon the letter,
the black letter of the law, "which," says our quibbling
counsellor, "ordains, 'that the person who
makes an affidavit shall lay his right hand upon the
book.' Now, this man having had his right hand
severed from his arm, and, as he informs us, left it in
Flanders, cannot comply with the letter of the law,
and therefore is not competent to make an affidavit;
that being once admitted, which I do contend must
be admitted, he cannot be deemed competent to
vote." "That," replies another gentleman of the
black robe, "I most pointedly deny; for though this
valiant veteran, who is an half-pay officer, has lost
much of his blood and three of his limbs in the
service of his king, and defence of his fellow-subjects,
yet the sword which deprived him of his hand has
not deprived him of his birthright. God forbid it
should! It might as well be argued and asserted,
that this gentleman is excluded from the rites of
matrimony because he cannot pledge his hand.
Thanks to our religion and our constitution, neither
law nor gospel holds such language, and it is beneath
me to waste any more words in the confutation of it.
I will only add,&mdash;and I do insist upon my opinion
being confirmed by every statute upon the case,&mdash;that
the law must and will consider this substitute for a
hand to be as good as the hand itself; and his laying
that upon the book is all which the law ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
require,&mdash;all the law can require,&mdash;all the law does
require."</p>

<p>Leaving these two bright luminaries of their profession
to throw dust, and render that obscure which
without their explanation would have been perfectly
clear, let us attend to the son of Solomon, who is
fastened in his chair and brought to give his voice
for a fit person to represent <em>him</em> in Parliament. This
is evidently a deaf idiot, but he is attended by a man
in fetters,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> very capable of prompting him, who is at
this moment roaring in his ear the name of the
gentleman for whom he is to vote. Behind him are
two fellows carrying a man wrapped in a blanket,
apparently in so languid a state, that he cannot be
supposed to feel much interest in the concerns of a
world he is on the point of leaving.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The catalogue
of this motley group of electors is concluded by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>blind man and a cripple, who are slowly and cautiously
ascending the steps that lead to the hustings.
In the group an artist is drawing a profile of one of
the candidates, and in both air and character this
Sayers of his day has given a very striking resemblance
of his original. The constable, fatigued by
double duty, is at peace with all mankind&mdash;a deep
sleep is upon him. Many of the crowd are attentively
listening to the soft sounds of a female siren, warbling
forth a brown paper libel on one of the candidates in
that universal language which those that cannot read
may yet understand,&mdash;the hero of this satire being
delineated as suspended to a gibbet on the top of the
ballad.</p>

<p>In the sinister corner is a view of Britannia's
chariot oversetting, while the coachman and footman
are playing at cards on the box. Here is one of the
few instances where Hogarth has mounted into the
cloudy heights of allegory; and here, as Mr. Walpole
justly observes, he is not happy: it is a dark and
dangerous region, in which almost every aeronaut of
the arts has lost himself, and confused his earth-born
admirers. On a bridge in the background is a
carriage, with colours flying, and a cavalcade composed
of worthy and independent freeholders advancing
to give their suffrages with all possible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>.</p>

<p>The village in the distance has a pretty effect. Of
the church we may fairly say, as Charles the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
did of that at Harrow on the Hill, "It is the <em>visible</em>
church."</p>

<p>Part of this plate was engraved by Morrilon le
Cave, who was a scholar of Picart's. In the year
1733, he engraved from Hogarth's design a small
print of Captain Coram, etc., as the headpiece to a
power of attorney for the Governors of the Foundling
Hospital: he also engraved a head of Doctor Pococke,
which is the frontispiece to Twell's edition of the
Doctor's works.</p>

duly elected, he is now exhibited in triumph. Seated
in an arm-chair, and exalted upon the shoulders of
four tried supporters of the constitution, he is borne
through the principal streets, which are promiscuously
crowded with enemies as well as friends. In this
aerostatic voyage there seems to be some danger of
a wreck; for a thresher having received an insult from
a sailor, in the act of revenging it flourishes his flail
in as extensive an orbit as if he were in his own
barn. The end of this destructive instrument coming
in contact with the skull of a bearer of our new-made
member, the fellow's head rings with the blow, his
eyes swim, his limbs refuse their office, and at this
inauspicious moment the effects of the stroke, like an
electric shock, extend to the exalted senator. He
trembles in every joint; the hat flies from his head&mdash;and&mdash;without
the intervention of Juno or Minerva,
he must fall from the seat of honour to the bed of
stone. Terrified at his impending danger, a nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>lady, who with her attendants is in the churchyard,
falls back in a swoon. Regardless of her distress, two
little chimney-sweepers upon the gate-post are placing
a pair of gingerbread spectacles on a death's head.
Their sportive tricks are likely to be interrupted by
a monkey beneath, who, arrayed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en militaire</i>, is
mounted upon a bear's back. The firelock slung
over this little animal's shoulder, in a fray between
the bear and a biped, is accidentally discharged in a
direction that, if loaded, must carry leaden death to
one of the gibing soot merchants above.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The venerable musician, delighted with his own
harmony, neither takes a part nor feels an interest in
the business of the day. Let not his neutrality be
attributed to a wrong cause; nor be it supposed that,
in a country where every good citizen must espouse
some party,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> this ancient personage would remain an
indifferent spectator were he not totally blind. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>an opposite corner a naked soldier is taking a few
refreshing grains of best Virginia, and preparing to
dress himself after the performance of a pugilistic
duet. On the other side of the rails a half-starved
French cook, a half-bred English cook, and a half-roasted
woman cook, are carrying three covers for
the lawyers' table. Near them is a cooper inspecting
a vessel that had been reported leaky, and must
speedily be filled with home-brewed ale for the gratification
of the populace. Two fellows are forcing
their way through the crowd in the background with
a barrel of the same liquor. Coming out of a street
behind them, a procession of triumphant electors hail
the other successful candidate, whose shadow appears
on the wall of the court-house. In Mr. Attorney's<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
first floor are a group of the defeated party glorying
in their security, and highly delighted with the confusion
below. One of these, distinguished by a riband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is said to be intended for the late Duke of Newcastle,
who was eminently active on these occasions. A
poor old lady is unfortunately thrown down by a
litter of pigs, which, followed by their <em>mamma</em>, rush
through the crowd with as much impetuosity as if
the whole herd were possessed. One of this agreeable
party has leaped, not into the ocean, but the brook,
and the whole family are on the point of following
its example.</p>

<p>Hogarth had surely some antipathy to tailors; in
the background he has introduced one of these
knights of the needle disciplined by his wife for
having quitted the shop-board to look at the gentlemen.
In Le Brun's "Battle of the Granicus," an eagle
is represented as hovering over the plumed helmet
of Alexander; this thought is very happily parodied
in a goose,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> flying immediately over the tye-wig of
our exalted candidate.</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols, in his <cite>Anecdotes of Hogarth</cite>, very
shrewdly observes that "the ruined house adjoining
to the attorney's is a stroke of satire that should
not be overlooked, because," adds the same writer, "it
intimates that nothing can thrive in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of such vermin."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In this inference I most sincerely
join, but am afraid that in the present instance
we cannot establish our data. The house is not in
ruins from the inhabitant having been unable to keep
it in repair, neither has it been torn by the teeth of
time; for it is apparently the wreck of a modern
edifice, which has been thus destroyed by a riotous
mob, because it belonged to one of the opposite
party.</p>

<p>An inscription on the sun-dial, when joined to the
mortuary representation on the church gate-post, has
been supposed to imply a pun hardly worthy of
Hogarth, but which yet I am inclined to suspect
he intended. "We must,"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> on the sun-dial, say some
of his illustrators, means&mdash;We must die all (<em>dial</em>).</p>

<p>All the incidents in this very whimsical plate are
naturally and yet skilfully combined: the whole is
in the highest degree laughable, and every figure
stamped with its proper character. The apprehensive
terror of the unwieldy member, the Herculean
strength of the exasperated thresher, and the energetic
attitude of the maimed sailor, deserve peculiar praise.</p>

<p>Previous to the publication of this series, Mr.
Hogarth's satire was generally aimed at the follies
and vices of individuals. He has here ventured to
dip his pencil in the ocean of politics, and delineated
the corrupt and venal conduct of our electors in the
choice of their representatives. That these four plates
display a picture in any degree applicable to the
present times must not be asserted, because it might,
by the help of <em>innuendo</em>, be construed into a libel on
the present upright and independent House of Commons:
but from the floating memorials of some little
transactions that took place some thirty or forty
years ago, there is reason to think that the people
of Great Britain were so far from being influenced by
a reverence for public virtue, that they began to
suspect it had no existence. Their faith in violent
professions of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor patriæ</i> had been staggered
by several recent instances of political depravity.
They had a few years before seen a William Pulteney,
the champion of patriots, the idol of the
people, the dread of ministers, desert from the party
of which he was a leader, quit the cause for which
he had been the most violent advocate, and accept a
peerage. This, and some similar circumstances, gave
an example and an apology for universal venality.</p>

<p>How different was the spirit which actuated the
Earl of Bath, from that independent dignity, that
patriotic ardour, that holy enthusiasm, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
emblazoned the name of Andrew Marvel<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> with a
saint-like glory! Let his name be consecrated by
the reverence and the gratitude of every Englishman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and may we live to see a band of senators who will
emulate his virtues! Could we have faith in speeches,
many which we have heard and read are of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
promise; let us hope that the day of performance
is at hand.</p>

<h3>THE MARCH TO FINCHLEY.</h3>

<p class="fs80">"Now I behold the chiefs in the pride of their former deeds; their
souls are kindled at the battles of old, and the actions of other times.
Their eyes are like flames of fire, and roll in search of the foes of the
land. Their mighty hands are on their swords, and lightning pours
from their sides of steel. They came like streams from the mountains;
each rushed roaring from his hill. Bright are the chiefs of battle in the
arms of their fathers."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fingal</span>, Book <span class="fs80">I.</span> p. 7.</p>

</div>


<p>That so admirable a representation of the
manners of England should be dedicated
to the King of Prussia,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> is one of those odd
circumstances which must surprise a man who is not
acquainted with the history of the plate. Before publication
it was inscribed to his late Majesty, and the
picture taken to St. James's, in the hope of royal approbation.
George the Second was an honest man and a
soldier, but not a judge of either a work of humour or
a work of art. The corporal or sergeant he considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>as employed in a way which dignified their nature,
and gave them a title to the name and rank of gentlemen.
The painter or engraver, however exquisite
their skill, however elevated their conceptions, were
on the King's scale mere mechanics.</p>

<p>When told that Hogarth had painted a picture of
the Guards on their march to Finchley, and meant
to dedicate a print engraved from it to the King of
Great Britain, his Majesty probably expected to see
an allegorical representation of an army of heroes
devoting their lives to the service of their country;
and their sovereign, habited like "the mailed Mars,"
seated upon a cloud, where he might,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">"With a commanding voice,</p>
<p class="verse">Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."</p>
</div></div>

<p>If such was his expectation, we may readily conceive
his disappointment on viewing this delineation. His
first question was addressed to a nobleman-in-waiting:
"Pray, who is this Hogarth?" "A painter, my
liege." "I hate <em>bainting</em>; and <em>boetry</em> too! neither the
one nor the other ever did any good! Does the fellow
mean to laugh at my Guards?" "The picture,
an please your Majesty, must undoubtedly be considered
as a burlesque." "What! a <em>bainter</em> burlesque
a soldier? he deserves to be picketed for his insolence!
Take his trumpery out of my sight."</p>

<p>The print was returned to the artist, who, completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>mortified at such a reception of what he very
properly considered as his first work, immediately
altered the inscription, inserting, instead of the King
of England, the King of Prussia (as an encourager of
the arts).</p>

<p>Though the fine arts were never much encouraged
in Prussia, the painter received a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'handsome ackowledgment'">handsome acknowledgment</ins>
for his dedication, and afterwards circulated
proposals for publishing his print by subscription.
Thus was it announced in the <cite>General Advertiser</cite> of
April 14, 1750:&mdash;"Mr. Hogarth is publishing by
subscription a print, representing 'The March to
Finchley' in the year 1746; engraved on a copperplate
22 inches by 17: the price, 7s. 6d.</p>

<p>"Subscriptions are taken in at the Golden Head,
in Leicester Fields, till the 30th of this instant, and
no longer, to the end that the engraving may not be
retarded.</p>

<p>"<em>Note.</em>&mdash;Each print will be half a guinea after the
subscription is over.</p>

<p>"In the subscription-book are the particulars of a
proposal, whereby each subscriber of three shillings
over and above the said seven shillings and sixpence
for the print will, in consideration thereof, be entitled
to a chance of having the original picture, which shall
be delivered to the winning subscriber as soon as the
engraving is finished."</p>

<p><cite>General Advertiser</cite>, May 1, 1750.&mdash;"Yesterday Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Hogarth's subscription was closed: eighteen hundred
and forty-three chances being subscribed for, Mr.
Hogarth gave the remaining hundred and sixty-seven
chances to the Foundling Hospital, and the same
night delivered the picture to the Governors."</p>

<p>By the fortunate number being among those presented
to a charity which he so much wished to serve,
the artist was highly gratified. In a private house it
would have been in a degree secluded from the public,
and by the lapse of time have been transferred to
those who could not appreciate its merit, and from
either negligence or ignorance, might have been
destroyed by damp walls, or effaced from the canvas
by picture-cleaners. Here, it was likely to remain a
permanent and honourable testimony of his talents
and liberality. Notwithstanding all this, Hogarth
soon after waited upon the treasurer of the hospital,
and acquainted him, that if the trustees thought
proper, they were at liberty to dispose of the picture
by auction. His motives for giving this permission
it is not easy to assign. They might have their origin
in his desire to enrich a foundation which had his
warmest wishes, or a natural though ill-judged ambition
to have his greatest work in the possession of
some one who had a collection of the old masters,
with whom he in no degree dreaded a competition.
Whether his mind was actuated by these or other
causes is not important; certain it is that his opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
changed&mdash;he requested the trustees would not dispose
of it, and never afterwards consented to the measure
he himself had originally proposed. The late Duke
of Ancaster's father wished to become a purchaser,
and once offered the trustees three hundred pounds
for it. I have been told that a much larger sum was
since proffered by another gentleman.</p>

<p>The scene is laid before the Adam and Eve, in
Tottenham Court Road, and entitled, "A Representation
of the March of the Guards towards Scotland
in the year 1745."</p>

<p>A handsome young grenadier has been denominated
the principal figure, but may with more propriety
be called the principal figure of the principal
group. His countenance exhibits a strong contest
between affection and duty; for the manner in which
his Irish helpmate clings to his arm, and at the same
time with threatening aspect lifts up her right hand
grasping the <cite>Remembrancer</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> proves to a moral
certainty that to her he has made a matrimonial
vow; while the tender, entreating distress of the poor
girl at his right hand, seems to intimate that, though
she possesses his heart, she can make no claim except
to his gratitude and affection, both of which her
present situation seems to demand. Her face forms
a strong contrast to that of the fury who is on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
other side; for while one is marked with grief and
tender regret, the other has all the savage ferocity of
an unchained tiger: she is an accomplished masculine
tramp, perfectly qualified to follow a regiment,
and would be as ready to plunder those that are
slaughtered as to scold those who escape: being by
no means of the class described by Dr. Johnson when,
speaking of superfluous epithets, he says, "they are
like the valets and washerwomen that follow an army,
who add to the number without increasing the force."
The papers of which these two claimants are the
vendors determine their principles. The mild-tempered,
soft-featured <em>gentlewoman</em> with a cross upon a
cloak, is evidently a hawker of the <cite>Jacobites' Journal</cite>,
<cite>Remembrancer</cite>, and <cite>London Evening Post</cite>, papers
remarkable for their inflammatory tendency; while a
portrait of the gallant Duke of Cumberland, and the
now popular ballad of <em>God save the King</em>, hang upon
the basket of her rival.</p>

<p>An old woman immediately behind, with a pipe in
her mouth and a child on her back, appears to have
grown rather ancient in the service; but notwithstanding
her load and her poverty, puffs away care, and
carries a cheerful countenance.</p>

<p>Near the child's head a meagre Frenchman is
whispering an old fellow, whom Mr. Thornton in his
description of the plate calls an Independent; but as
in the original painting part of a plaid appears under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his greatcoat, the artist most probably intended it
for an old Highlander in disguise. Rouquet, who
perhaps had his explanation from Hogarth, describes
it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"A droite du principal group paroit une figure de
François, qu'on a voulu représenter comme un homme
de quelque importance, afin de lui donner plus de
ridicule; il parle à un homme dont la nation est indiquée
par l'étoffe de sa veste, qui est celui dont
s'habillent les habitans des montagnes d'Ecosse: le
François semble communiquer à l'Ecossois des lettres
qu'il vient de recevoir, et qui ont rapport à l'évenement
qui donne lieu à cette marche. Les Anglois ne
se réjouissent jamais bien sans qu'il en coute quelque
chose aux François: leur théatre, leur conversation,
leurs tableaux, et sur tout ceux de notre peintre,
portent toujours cette glorieuse marque de l'amour
de la patrie: les Romans même sont ornés de traits
amusans sur cet ancien sujet; l'excellent auteur de
<cite>Tom Jones</cite>, a voulu aussi lâcher les siens. Mais le
prétendu mépris pour les François dont le peuple de
ce pais-ci fait profession, s'explique selon moi d'une
façon fort équivoque. Le mépris suppose l'oubli;
mais un objet dont on médit perpétuellement occupé:
la satire constitue une attention qui me feroit soupçonner
qu'on fait aux François l'honneur de les haïr
un peu."</p>

<p>A drummer, sick of the remonstrances of his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and child, each of whom made a forcible seizure of
his person, actuated by a spirit similar to that of our
third Richard, beats a thundering tattoo upon his
own warlike instrument; and aided by the ear-piercing
fife<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> at his right hand, drowns the noise of the tell-tale
woman who thus endeavours to check his ardour and
impede his march. A war-worn soldier contemplating
a quack-doctor's bill, and a woman peeping out of a
pent-house above, end the group at the left corner.</p>

<p>Under a sign of the Adam and Eve a crowd are
gathered round two combatants, who appear to be
adepts in the noble science of boxing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Amid the circle now each champion stands,</p>
<p class="verse">And poises high in air his iron hands;</p>
<p class="verse">Hurling defiance; now they fiercely close&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A man, who from his dress seems to be of a rank
superior to the crowd, inflamed with a love of glory,
enters with great spirit into the business now going
on, and tries to inspire the combatants with a noble
contempt of bruises and broken bones. This is said
to be a portrait of Lord Albemarle Bertie, who is
again exhibited in "The Cockpit." The scene being
laid in the background, the figures are diminutive;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but every countenance is marked with interest, and
no one more than a little fellow<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of meagre frame
but undaunted spirit, who with clenched fists and
agitated face deals blow for blow with the combatants.
Somerville, in his <cite>Rural Games</cite>, has well
described the passions which agitate the audience in
a similar scene at a country wake:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Each swain his wish, each trembling nymph conceals</p>
<p class="verse">Her secret dread; while every panting breast</p>
<p class="verse">Alternate fears and hopes depress or raise.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus, long in dubious scale the contest hung," etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p>With a humour peculiar to himself, the painter has
exhibited a figure shrinking under the weight of a
heavy burden, who, preferring the gratification of
curiosity to rest, is a spectator, and in this uneasy
state waits the issue of the combat.</p>

<p>Upon the sign-board of the Adam and Eve is inserted,
"Tottenham Court Nursery," allusive to a
booth for bruising in the place, as well as a nursery
for plants, and the group of figures beneath.</p>

<p>A carriage laden with camp equipage, consisting of
drums, halberds, tent-poles, and hoop petticoats, is
passing through the turnpike gate. Upon this, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
old female campaigners are puffing their pipes, and
holding a conversation in fire and smoke. These
grotesque personages are well contrasted by an elegant
and singularly delicate figure upon the same
carriage, suckling her child; which, it has been said,
proves that the painter is as successful in portraying
the graceful as the humorous. This very beautiful
figure is, however, almost a direct copy from Guido's
"Madonna." To show that a little boy at her feet is of
an heroic stock, the artist has represented him blowing
a small trumpet. The sergeant on the ground beneath
seems exerting the authority with which his post
vests him in calling his men to order: he has a true
roast-beef countenance, and is haughty enough for a
general.</p>

<p>The foreground in the centre is occupied by a
group of figures, which tell their own story in a
manner that perhaps no other artist of any age could
have equalled. While an officer is kissing a milk-maid,
an arch soldier, taking advantage of her
neglected pails, fills his hat with milk: this is observed
by a little chimney-sweeper, who, with a grin
upon his face, entreats that he may have a share
in the plunder, and fill his cap. Another soldier
pointing out the jest to a fellow who is selling pies,
the pastry-cook, gratified by the mischief, forgets the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'luscious cates'">luscious cakes</ins> in the tray on his head, and the
military Mercury seems likely to convey them all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
his own pocket. The faces of this group are in a
most singular degree descriptive of their situations,
and consonant to their mischievous employments.</p>

<p>An old soldier, divested of one spatterdash, near
losing the other, and felled to the ground by all-potent
gin, is now calling for more; his uncivil comrade,
supporting him with one hand, endeavours to
pour water into his mouth with the other; this the
veteran toper rejects with disdain, and lifts up a hand
to his wife, who is bearer of the arms and the bottle,
and being well acquainted with his taste, fills another
quartern.</p>

<p>A child with emaciated face extends its little arms,
and wishes for a taste of that poisonous potion it is
probably accustomed to swallow: "And here" (says
Mr. Thornton in the <cite>Student</cite>), "not to dwell wholly
upon the beauties of this print, I must mention an
error discovered by a professed connoisseur in painting.
'Can there,' says this excellent judge, 'be a greater
absurdity than introducing a couple of chickens so
near such a crowd; and not only so, but see their
direction is to objects it is natural for them to shun.&mdash;Is
this knowledge of nature? Absurd to the last
degree!' And here, with an air of triumph, ended
our judicious critic. How great was his surprise,
when it was pointed out that the said chickens
were in pursuit of the hen, which appears to have a
resting-place in a sailor's pocket!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>An honest tar, throwing up his hat, is crying "God
save our noble King, God save the King:" immediately
before him an image of drunken loyalty
vows de&mdash;de&mdash;destruction on the heads of the rebels.</p>

<p>A humane soldier perceiving a fellow heavy laden
with a barrel of gin, and stopped by the crowd, bores
a hole in the head of his cask, and kindly draws off a
part of his burden. Near him is a figure of what
may, in the army, be called a fine fellow.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> As I
suppose the painter designed him without character,
I shall only observe that he is a very pretty gentleman;
and happily the contemplation of his own dear
person guards him from the attempts of the wicked
woman on his right hand.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The invention of a new term must be pardoned&mdash;I
shall include the whole King's Head in the word
Cattery; the principal figure is a noted fat Covent
Garden lady,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> who, with pious eyes cast up to heaven,
prays for the army's success, and the safe return of
many of her babes of grace. An officer having placed
a letter on the end of his pike, presents it to one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>the beauties in the first floor; but the fair <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">enamorata</i>,
evidently disgusted at the recollection of some part
of his former conduct, flutters her fan and rejects it
with disdain. Above her, a charitable girl of an
inferior order is throwing a piece of coin to a cripple,
while another kindly administers a glass of comfort
to her companion as a sure relief against reflection.
The rest of the windows are crowded with similar characters,
and upon the house-top is a Cat coterie, a fair
emblem of the company in the apartments beneath.</p>

<p>The substance of the preceding remarks are, in this
as in the first edition, taken from the <cite>Student</cite>, vol. ii.
p. 162, and were made by the late Bonnell Thornton.
In the <cite>Old Woman's Magazine</cite>, Doctor Hill has given
an explanation which places it in a point of view somewhat
different; I have therefore subjoined the greatest
part of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><em>To the Editor.</em></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As you desire my sentiments on Mr.
Hogarth's picture, I shall begin with pointing out
what is most defective. Its first and greatest fault,
then, is its being new, and having too great a resemblance
to the objects it represents: if this appears
a paradox, you ought to take particular care of confessing
it. This picture has yet too much of that
lustre,&mdash;that despicable freshness which we discover
in nature, and which is never seen in the celebrated
cabinets of the curious. Time has not yet obscured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it with that venerable smoke, that sacred cloud which
will one day conceal it from the profane eyes of the
vulgar, that its beauties may only be seen by those
who are initiated in the mysteries of art. These are
its most remarkable faults: and I am next going to
give you an idea of the subject, which is the march of
some companies of the foot guards to their rendezvous
at Finchley Common, when sent against the Scottish
rebels, who were advancing on that side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hogarth, who lets no opportunity escape him
of observing the picturesque scenes which numerous
assemblies frequently furnish, has not failed to represent
them on the spot where he has drawn the scene
of his picture.</p>

<p>"The painter is remarkable for a particular sagacity
in seizing a thousand little circumstances which escape
the observation of the greatest part of the spectators,
and it is a collection of a number of those circumstances
which has composed, enriched, and diversified
his work.</p>

<p>"The scene is placed at Tottenham Court, where,
in a distant view, is seen a file of soldiers marching in
tolerable order up the hill. Discipline is less observed
in the principal design; but if you complain of this, I
must ingeniously inform you, that order and subordination
belong only to slaves; for what everywhere
else is called licentiousness, assumes here the venerable
name of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"A young grenadier, of a good mien, makes the
principal figure in the first group; he is accompanied,
or rather seized and beset, by two women, one of whom
is a ballad-singer, and the other a news-hawker: they
are both with child, and claim this hero as the father,
and except this circumstance they have nothing in
common; for their figures, their humours, their characters,
appear extremely different: they are even of
opposite parties, for the one disposes of works in
favour of the Government, and the other against it.</p>

<p>"On the left hand of this group is an officer embracing
a milk-woman; but her greatest misfortune
is, not her being hugged by a young cavalier, but in
having one of her milk-pails seized by a wag, who
pours her milk into a hat, while he is pretending to
defend her. Near them is a pieman, who is mightily
rejoiced at this roguery; while a soldier, who is fleering
in his face, slily steals the pies he carries on his
head. The humour of this group is greatly heightened
by a chimney-sweeper's boy, who comes laughing to
receive some of the milk into his hat, which he carries
in his hand.</p>

<p>"On the right hand of the principal group is a
Frenchman, who, to give him a more ridiculous appearance,
is represented as a man of some importance.
He is speaking to a very odd person, to whom he
seems communicating the contents of some letters
relative to the event which is the cause of this march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Behind the Frenchman just mentioned is seen an
old sutler, who carries her child at her back, and is
smoking a short pipe. In the front, at a small distance,
is a drummer, who by the noise of his drum
seems to endeavour to stun all thoughts of the fate of
his family, who seek in vain to soften him by taking
a tender leave.</p>

<p>"One of the young pipers whom the Duke of
Cumberland has introduced into several regiments,
joins his noise to that of the drum, and by the agreeable
appearance of his little person, is a contrast to
the rudeness of the objects who are near him, etc. etc."</p></div>

<p>To the dramatic effect of the picture, the late Mr.
Arthur Murphy, whose acknowledged judgment give
weight to his praise, bears the following honourable
testimony in the <cite>Gray's Inn Journal</cite>, vol. i. No. 20:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The era may arrive, when, through the instability
of the English language, the style of <cite>Joseph Andrews</cite>
and <cite>Tom Jones</cite> shall be obliterated, when the characters
shall be unintelligible, and the humour lose its
relish; but the many personages which the manner-painting
hand of Hogarth has called forth into mimic
life will not fade so soon from the canvas, and that
admirable picturesque comedy, 'The March to
Finchley,' will perhaps divert posterity as long as the
Foundling Hospital shall do honour to the British
nation."</p></div>

<h3>THE INVASION; OR, FRANCE AND ENGLAND.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_137.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In the two following designs Mr. Hogarth
has displayed that partiality for his own
country, and contempt for France, which
formed a strong trait in his character. He neither
forgot nor forgave the insults he suffered at Calais,
though he did not recollect that this treatment originated
in his own ill-humour, which threw a sombre
shade over every object that presented itself. Having
early imbibed the vulgar prejudice that one Englishman
was a match for four Frenchmen,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> he thought it
would be doing his country a service to prove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
position. How far it is either useful or political to
depreciate the power or degrade the character of that
people with whom we are to contend, is a question
which does not come within the plan of this work.
In some cases it may create confidence, but in others
leads to the indulgence of that negligent security by
which armies have been slaughtered, provinces depopulated,
and kingdoms changed their rulers.</p>

<p>These two glaring contrasts were designed at a
time when there was a rumour of an invasion from
France. The sober politician treated this idle report
with contempt; but by the credulous it was believed,
and the timid trembled when they heard it. To
dispel this phantom of the day was one motive for
Hogarth's publication of these prints. They are not
addressed to the philosopher or the legislator, but
to the soldier and the sailor. They are not designed
for the contemplation of the informed and travelled
man, who considers himself as a citizen of the world;
but for the true-born and true-bred Briton, that
believes this to be the only country where man can
enjoy happiness, and thinks an Englishman is the
boast of the universe, the glory of creation, and the
paragon of nature!</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The scenes of all Mr. Hogarth's prints, except "The
Gate of Calais" and that now under consideration, are
laid in England. In this, having quitted his own
country, he seems to think himself out of the reach of
the critics, and in delineating a Frenchman, at liberty
to depart from nature, and sport in the fairy regions
of caricature. Were these Gallic soldiers naked, each
of them would appear like a forked radish, with a
head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. So
forlorn! that to any thick sight he would be invisible!
To see this miserable woe-begone refuse
of the army, who look like a group detached from
the main body and put on the sick-list, embarking to
conquer a neighbouring kingdom, is ridiculous enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and at the time of publication must have had great
effect. The artist seemed sensible that it was necessary
to account for the unsubstantial appearance of
these shadows of men, and has hinted at their want
of solid food, in the bare bones of beef hung up in
the window, the inscription on the alehouse sign,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soup maigre à la sabot Royal</span>," and the spider-like
officer roasting four frogs which he has impaled upon
his sword. Such light and airy diet is whimsically
opposed by the motto on the standard, which two of
the most valorous of this ghastly troop are hailing
with grim delight and loud exultation. It is indeed
an attractive motto, and well calculated to inspire
this famishing company with courage: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vengeance,
avec le bon bier, et bon beuf d'Angleterre.</span>" However
meagre the military, the church militant is in no
danger of starving. The portly friar is neither emaciated
by fasting, nor weakened by penance. Anticipating
the glory of extirpating heresy, he is feeling
the sharp edge of an axe to be employed in the
decollation of the enemies to the true faith, which if
any one doubt, he shall die the death. A sledge is
laden with whips, wheels, ropes, chains, gibbets, and
other inquisitorial engines of torture, which are admirably
calculated for the propagation of a religion
that was established in meekness and mercy, and
inculcates universal charity and forbearance. On the
same sledge is an image of St. Anthony, very properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>accompanied by his pig, and the plan of a monastery
to be built at Blackfriars.</p>

<p>In the background are a troop of soldiers so averse
to this English expedition, that their sergeant is
obliged to goad them forward with his halberd. To
intimate that agriculture suffers by the invasion having
engaged the masculine inhabitants, two women
ploughing a sterile promontory in the distance complete
this catalogue of wretchedness, misery, and
famine.</p>

<p class="noindent">From the unpropitious regions of France, our scene

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Instead of the forlorn and famished party who were
represented in the last plate, we here see a company
of well-fed and high-spirited Britons, marked with all
the hardihood of ancient times, and eager to defend
their country.</p>

<p>In the first group, a young peasant who aspires to
a niche in the Temple of Fame, preferring the service
of Mars to that of Ceres, and the dignified appellation
of soldier to the plebeian name of farmer, offers to
enlist. Standing with his back against the halberd
to ascertain his height, and finding he is rather under
the mark,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> he endeavours to reach it by rising on
tiptoe. This artifice, to which he is impelled by
<em>towering ambition</em>, the sergeant seems disposed to
connive at&mdash;and the sergeant is a hero, and a great
man in his way; "your hero always must be tall,
you know."</p>

<p>To evince that the polite arts were then in a
flourishing state, and cultivated by more than the
immediate professors, a gentleman artist, who to
common eyes must pass for a grenadier, is making a
caricature of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Grand Monarque</i>. The sovereign of
France was in that day as general a subject for
copper satire as Mr. Fox is in this. I have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>engravings, where his Gallic Majesty made one of the
party, that were not a degree better than the grenadier's
drawing, where, to render the meaning obvious,
and supply the want of character, or story, every
figure had a label hanging to its mouth. That given
to this king of shreds and patches is worthy the
speaker, and worthy observation: "You take a my
fine ships: you be de pirate; you be de teef: me
send my grand armies, and hang you all."</p>

<p>The action is suited to the word, for with his left
hand this most Christian potentate grasps his sword,
and in his right poises a gibbet. The figure and
motto united, produce a roar of approbation from the
soldier and sailor, who are criticising the work. It
is so natural, that the Helen and Briseis of the camp
contemplate the performance with apparent delight;
and while one of them with her apron measures the
breadth of this Herculean painter's shoulders, the
other, to show that the performance <em>has some point</em>,
places her forefinger against the prongs of a fork.
The little fifer, playing that animated and inspiring
tune "God save the King," is an old acquaintance:
we recollect him in "The March to Finchley." In
the background is a sergeant teaching a company
of young recruits their manual exercise.</p>

<p>This military meeting is held at the sign of the
gallant Duke of Cumberland, who is mounted upon
a prancing charger,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"As if an angel dropt down from the clouds,</p>

</div></div>

<p>Underneath is inscribed, "Roast and boiled every
day;" which, with the beef and beverage upon the
table, forms a fine contrast to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soup maigre</i>, bare
bones, and roasted frogs, in the last print. The
bottle painted on the wall, foaming with liquor
which, impatient of imprisonment, has burst its cerements,
must be an irresistible invitation to a thirsty
traveller. The soldier's sword laid upon the round
of beef, and the sailor's pistol on the vessel containing
the ale, intimate that these great bulwarks of our
island are as tenacious of their beef and beer as of
their religion and liberty.</p>

<p>These two plates were published in 1756; but in
the <cite>London Chronicle</cite> for October 20, 1759, is the
following advertisement:&mdash;</p>

coarse enough. They were, however, written

more elegant stanzas.</p>

<h3>THE COCKPIT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is worth your while to come to England, were it only to see an
election and a cock-match. There is a celestial spirit of anarchy and
confusion in these two scenes that words cannot paint, and of which
no countryman of yours can form even an idea."&mdash;<cite>Sherlock's Letters to a
friend at Paris.</cite></p></div>

<div class="caption">THE COCKPIT.</div>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_146.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capy">Mr. Sherlock is perfectly right in his
assertion, that neither of these scenes can
be described by words; but where the writer
must have failed, the artist has succeeded, and the
Parisian who has never visited England may, from
Mr. Hogarth's Prints, form a tolerably correct idea
of the anarchy of an election, and the confusion of
a cockpit. To the right learned and laborious successors
of Master Thomas Hearne, it would be matter
of curious speculation, and worthy of deep research,
to inquire which of these "popular sportes was fyrste
practysed in fair Englonde." To their grave and useful
investigations I leave the decision of this knotty
point. The earliest information of this <em>gentile</em> and
<em>royal</em> game which my reading supplies, I find in a
treatise, published in 1674, and entitled <cite>The Complete
Gamester</cite>, containing instructions how to play at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Billiards, Trucks, Bowls, Chess, etc. "To which is
added, The Artes and Mysteries of Riding, Racing,
Archery, and Cock Fighting. Printed by A. M. for
R. Cutler, and to be sold by Henry Brome, at the
Gun, at the west end of St. Paul's." To this curious
little <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vade mecum</i> there is a frontispiece divided into
five compartments. One of them represents a cockpit,
in the centre of which two of the feathered tribe,
not unlike ducks, are fighting. The pit is surrounded
by a company of crop-eared figures in round hats,
with faces as demure and sanctified as are to be seen
at a Quakers' meeting. Before many of these most
sedate personages are heaps of gold, and (alluding to
the print) the following sublime verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"After these three, the cockpit claims a name;</p>
<p class="verse">A sport <em>gentile</em>, and call'd a royal game.</p>
<p class="verse">Now see the gallants crowd about the pit,</p>
<p class="verse">And most are stock'd with money more than wit;</p>
<p class="verse">Else sure they would not, with so great a stir,</p>
<p class="verse">Lay ten to one on a cock's faithless spur."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To the respect which our ancestors had for this
<em>kingly</em> amusement, the author beareth ample testimony
in his 38th chapter, some extracts from which
I venture to insert, with the hope that they will be
both pleasant and profitable to the lovers of this
very refined and humane divertisement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is a sport or pastime so full of delight and
pleasure, that I know not any game in that respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
is to be preferred before it; and since the fighting
cock hath gained so great an estimation among the
gentry, in respect to this noble recreation, I shall
here propose it before all the other games of which I
have afore succinctly discoursed. That, therefore, I
may methodically give instructions to such as are
unlearned, and add more knowledge to such who
have already gained a competent proficiency in this
pleasing art, I shall, as briefly as I can, give you
information how you shall choose, breed, and diet
the fighting cock, with what choice secrets are thereunto
belonging, in order thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the election<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> of a fighting cock, there are four
things principally to be considered; and they are:
shape, colour, courage, and a sharp heel.</p>

<p>"Observe the crowing of your chickens; if you find
them crow too soon, that is, before six months old,
or unseasonably, and that their crowing is clear and
loud, fit them as soon as you can for the pot or spit,
for they are infallible signs of cowardice and falsehood:
on the contrary, the true and perfect cock is
long before he obtaineth his voice, and when he hath
got it, observeth his hours with the best judgment."</p></div>

<p>After much more which I have not room to insert, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
author addeth, "To conclude, make your choice of
such a one that is of shape strong, of colour good, of
valour true, and of heel sharp and ready."</p>

<p>Leaving the book to the study of those whom it
may concern, let us now attend to the plate.</p>

<p>The scene is probably laid at Newmarket;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and in
this motley group of peers, pickpockets, butchers,
jockeys, ratcatchers, gentlemen,&mdash;gamblers of every
denomination,&mdash;Lord Albemarle Bertie,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> being the
principal figure, is entitled to precedence. In a former
print<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> we saw him an attendant at a boxing
match; and here he is president of a most respectable
society assembled at a cockpit. What rendered his
Lordship's passion for amusements of this nature very
singular, was his being totally blind. In this place
he is beset by seven steady friends, five of whom at
the same instant offer to bet with him on the event of
the battle. One of them, a lineal descendant of Filch,
taking advantage of his blindness and negligence,
endeavours to convey a bank note, deposited in our
dignified gambler's hat, to his own pocket. Of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>ungentleman-like attempt his Lordship is apprised
by a ragged postboy and an honest butcher: but so
much engaged in the pronunciation of those important
words, "Done! done! done! done!" and the
arrangement of his bets, that he cannot attend to
their hints; and it seems more than probable that
the stock will be <em>transferred</em> and the note <em>negotiated</em>
in a few seconds.</p>

<p>A very curious group surround the old nobleman,
who is adorned with a riband, a star, and a pair of
spectacles. The whole weight of an overgrown carpenter
being laid upon his shoulder, forces our illustrious
personage upon a man beneath; who being
thus driven downward, falls upon a fourth; and the
fourth, by the accumulated pressure of this ponderous
trio&mdash;composed of the <em>upper and lower house</em>&mdash;loses
his balance, and tumbling against the edge of the
partition, his head is broke, and his wig, shook from
the seat of reason, falls into the cockpit.</p>

<p>A man adjoining enters into the spirit of the battle&mdash;his
whole soul is engaged. From his distorted
countenance and clasped hands, we see that he feels
every stroke given to his favourite bird in his heart's
core, ay, in his heart of hearts! A person at the old
Peer's left hand is likely to be a loser. Ill-humour,
vexation, and disappointment are painted in his countenance.
The chimney-sweeper above is the very
quintessence of affectation. He has all the airs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
graces of a boarding-school miss. There are those
who remember the man, and declare that his character
is not heightened in the portrait. The sanctified
Quaker adjoining, and the fellow beneath, who, by the
way, is a very similar figure to Captain Stab in "The
Rake's Progress," are finely contrasted.</p>

<p>A French marquis, on the other side, astonished
at this being called amusement, is exclaiming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauvages!
sauvages! sauvages!</i> Engrossed by the scene,
and opening his snuff-box rather carelessly, its contents
fall into the eyes of a man below, who, sneezing
and swearing alternately, imprecates bitter curses on
this devil's dust, that extorts from his inflamed eyes
"a sea of melting pearls, which some call tears."</p>

<p>Adjoining is an old cripple with a trumpet at his
ear, and in this trumpet a person in a bag-wig roars in
a manner that cannot much gratify the auricular nerves
of his companions; but as for the object to whom
the voice is directed, he seems totally insensible to
sounds, and if judgment can be formed from appearances,
might very composedly stand close to the clock
of St. Paul's Cathedral when it was striking twelve.</p>

<p>The figure with a cock peeping out of a bag is said
to be intended for Jackson, a jockey. The gravity of
this experienced veteran, and the cool sedateness of a
man registering the wagers, are well opposed by the
grinning woman behind, and the heated impetuosity
of a fellow, stripped to his shirt, throwing his coin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
upon the cockpit, and offering to back Ginger against
Pye for a guinea.</p>

<p>On the lower side, where there is only one tier of
figures, a sort of an apothecary, and a jockey, are
stretching out their arms and striking together the
handles of their whips in token of a bet. An hiccuping
votary of Bacchus, displaying a half-emptied purse,
is not likely to possess it long; for an adroit professor
of legerdemain has taken aim with an hooked stick,
and by one slight jerk will convey it to his own
pocket. The profession of a gentlemen in a round
wig is determined by a gibbet chalked upon his coat.
An enraged barber, who lifts up his stick in the corner,
has probably been refused payment of a wager by
the man at whom he is striking.</p>

<p>A cloud-capt philosopher at the top of the print,
coolly smoking his pipe, unmoved by this crash of
matter and wreck of property, must not be overlooked:
neither should his dog be neglected; for the
dog, gravely resting his fore-paws upon the partition,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and contemplating the company, seems more interested
in the event of the battle than his master.</p>

<p>Like the tremendous Gog and terrific Magog of
Guildhall, stand the two cock-feeders; a foot of each
of these consequential purveyors is seen at the two
extremities of the pit.</p>

<p>As to the birds whose attractive powers have drawn
this admiring throng together, they deserved earlier
notice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Each hero burns to conquer or to die,</p>
<p class="verse">What mighty hearts in little bosoms lie!"</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Having disposed of the substances, let us now
attend to the shadow on the cockpit, and this it seems
is the reflection of a man drawn up to the ceiling in
a basket, and there suspended<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> as a punishment for
having betted more money than he can pay. Though
suspended, he is not reclaimed; though exposed, not
abashed; for in this degrading situation he offers to
stake his watch against money in another wager on
his favourite champion.</p>

<p>The decorations of this curious theatre are, a
portrait of Nan Rawlins,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and the King's arms.</p>

<p>In the margin at the bottom of the print is an oval,
with a fighting cock, inscribed "Royal sport," and
underneath it is written, "Pit ticket."</p>

<p>Of the characteristic distinctions in this heterogeneous
assembly, it is not easy to speak with
sufficient praise. The chimney-sweeper's absurd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>affectation sets the similar airs of the Frenchman in a
most ridiculous point of view. The old fellow with a
trumpet at his ear has a degree of deafness that I
never before saw delineated; he might have lived in
the same apartment with Xantippe, or slept comfortably
in Alexander the coppersmith's first floor. As
to the nobleman in the centre, in the language of
the turf, he is a mere pigeon; and the Peer, with a
star and garter, in the language of Cambridge, we
must class as&mdash;a mere quiz. The man sneezing, you
absolutely hear; and the fellow stealing a bank note
has all the outward and visible marks of a perfect and
accomplished pickpocket; Mercury himself could not
do that business in a more masterly style.</p>

<p>I hope it will not be thought irrelevant to my
subject if I here name a man whose periods have
polished the English language, and given to poesy a
harmony before unknown.</p>

<p>To Alexander Pope, Hogarth had an early dislike.
Pope was the friend of Lord Burlington,&mdash;Lord
Burlington was the patron of Kent, and Kent was the
rival of Sir James Thornhill, who was the father-in-law
of William Hogarth. In two of his miscellaneous
prints, our mellifluous poet is exhibited in very
degrading situations. In one<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> he is represented as

<p>Had the artist been acquainted with a circumstance
mentioned by Mr. Tyers in his <cite>Rhapsody</cite>, our British
Horace would very probably have had a place in this
group. Tyers tells us that "Pope, while living with
his father at Chiswick, before he went to Binfield, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
great delight in cock-fighting, and laid out all his
schoolboy money, and little perhaps it was, in buying
fighting cocks. From this passion, but surely not the
play of a child, his mother had the dexterity to wean
him."</p>

<p>Admitting the fact, for which I have no other
authority than the pamphlet above quoted, it does not
tell in favour of that delicate and tender humanity
which this elegant poet so much affected. On his
conduct to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Lord
Bolingbroke, Mr. Addison, and Mr. Broome, I will
make no comment; but his bitter satire on the Duke
of Chandos,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> while it exalts his poetical powers, dishonours
his moral character. The animation, energy,
and elegance of the stanzas would atone for almost
anything&mdash;but <em>ingratitude</em>!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Orrery observes: "If we may judge of Mr.
Pope from his works, his chief aim was to be esteemed
a man of virtue." When actions can be clearly ascertained,
it is not necessary to seek the mind's construction
in the writings; and I regret being compelled to
believe that some of Mr. Pope's actions, at the same
time that they prove him to be querulous and petulant,
lead us to suspect that he was also envious, malignant,
and cruel. How far this will tend to confirm the
assertion, that when a boy he was an amateur<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of this
royal sport,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> I do not pretend to decide: but were a
child in whom I had any interest cursed with such a
propensity, my first object would be to correct it; if
that were impracticable, and he retained a fondness
for the cockpit, and the still more detestable amusement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>of Shrove Tuesday,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> I should hardly dare to
flatter myself that he could become a merciful man.
The subject has carried me further than I intended.
I will, however, take the freedom of proposing one
query to the consideration of the clergy, should any
of that sacred order do me the honour of perusing
this volume. Might it not have a tendency to check
that barbarous spirit, which has more frequently its
source in an early acquired habit arising from the
prevalence of example than in natural depravity, if
every divine in Great Britain were to preach at least
one sermon every twelve months on our universal
insensibility to the sufferings of the brute creation?<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p class="drop-capy">Whoever reads history with a view of
tracing the progress of the human mind,&mdash;which,
by the way, is the great object that
renders history useful,&mdash;whoever reads history with
that regard, must be astonished and shocked at the
slow progress of philosophy, and the universal prevalence
of credulity, superstition, and fanaticism. If
antiquity would give a claim to reverence, this destructive
band have a date prior to Christianity; their
united power shed baneful influence on the earliest
ages.</p>

<p>In the pagan temples there was a kind of incantation
for conjuring down deities, to whom were assigned
niches according to their different degrees of rank.
The histories of Greece and Rome (for the sake of
human nature, I wish that the parallel did not reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>modern times) display an innumerable host of all ages,
sexes, descriptions, and characters, enlisted under the
banner of the priesthood, together with a select <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps
de reserve</i> of augurs and soothsayers, who, by inspecting
the entrails of beasts, foretold future events,
and from the flight of birds the defeat of armies.
Succeeding ages beheld their heathen temples solemnly
consecrated; and being thus metamorphosed
into Christian churches, the sculptures representing
Jupiter, Minerva, Venus, and Diana, by virtue of a
new baptism, became saints.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Here also were a legion of arrogant priests, who
insolently dictated the terms of salvation, fixed a
standard for universal belief, and introduced their
own inventions as divine precepts; who forced
monarchs to pay tribute by ecclesiastical privilege,
assumed the dominion of empires by divine right,
and claimed three-fourths of the known world as
heirs-at-law to St. Peter. To secure their acquisitions,
they entrenched themselves behind ramparts
raised on the credulity and folly of mankind. He
who attempted to scale these hallowed mounds was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
deemed guilty of sacrilege; he who questioned the
catholic infallibility was an atheist; and whosoever
doubted the divine mission of a priest&mdash;an infidel.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Finding the multitude were so well inclined to believe
that whatever they could not comprehend was
supernatural, they construed each phenomenon of
nature into a portentous menace from Heaven. An
eclipse became the omen of a revolution; an inundation
the prognostic of a defeat; and an hurricane
foretold the fall of every power that made any opposition
to papal authority. By arts like these, the
people were brought into a mental vassalage; and the
powerful Baron having previously enslaved their persons,
they readily gave the care of their souls to the
confessor. To him they applied as the proper interpreter
of every difficult case; and fraught with a full
portion of credulity, each individual considered every
cloud that passed over the sun, and every raven that
expanded its ebon wing, as bearing some particular
direction to himself. Hence arose the doctrine of
demonology; and apparitions, witches, dreams, and
divinations, formed a creed of superstition. On this
was built that notable system, properly enough called
"The Philosophy of the Distaff." This mythology
of weak minds has been carried through every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
age and country by oral tradition and unfounded
record.</p>

<p>Our earliest histories abound in augury and prediction;
the most fabulous tales had credence, not
only with the unlearned and ignorant, but with the
educated and sagacious. The grave Duke de Sully
seriously narrates those which had relation to Henry
the Fourth.</p>

<p>It is recorded by Victorius Sirri, that Louis the
Thirteenth was from his infancy surnamed Just,&mdash;"because
he was born under the sign of the Balance!"</p>

<p>Even sorcery was made a leading branch of religion;
and one of a priest's duties was to exorcise ghosts
by talking Latin, which was considered as a never-failing
antidote for a troublesome spirit, and invariably
concluded by the ghost being <em>laid in the Red Sea</em>.</p>

<p>Some of these glaring errors have been obliterated,
but absurdities of equal magnitude have supplied
their place; and modern credulities are nearly as
destructive to the interests of society as ancient superstitions.</p>

<p>Though this nation, as well as others, was at an
early period enveloped by ignorance, superstition,
and their consequent accompaniments, we had some
right to expect the clouds would have been dispelled
by the Reformation; but credulity kept its ground,
and at a still later period&mdash;when we had a most
learned and sedate monarch, and a most sententious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and grave Parliament&mdash;an Act was passed for the
punishment of witchcraft! By this sagacious union
of royal and national wisdom, if a woman lived to a
greater age than her neighbour, she was tried, proved
guilty of commercing with a familiar in the shape of
a tabby cat, and eased of all her sufferings by the
ordeal of fire or water.</p>

<p>It is not many years since a fanatic in one of our
colonies took a fancy to accuse a neighbour of witchcraft:
the crime was clearly proved, and the poor
culprit suffered according to law. In credulity and
superstition there is something epidemical. The contagion
spread; and this being found a summary process
for removing a competitor in trade, or revenging
an insult, informations for sorcery became frequent.
Their sessions-house was crowded with witches, as is
that at the Old Bailey with pickpockets. It however
brought fees, and so far was well: but these sapient
legislators at length discovered that the province was
likely to be depopulated; and what affected them
still more, their own fraternity were liable to the
consequences. A man, who had been cheated by
his lawyer, made an affidavit that said lawyer was
a wizard. This was too much: the court had a
special meeting, and unanimously determined that
they would not receive any more informations against
wizards. The bye-law had the effect of a charm,
and sorcery was no more!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Bacon somewhere remarks that superstition
is worse than atheism. It takes from religion every
attraction, every comfort; and the place of humble
hope and patient resignation is supplied by melancholy,
despair, and madness!</p>

<p>To the best minds, credulity is the source of much
misery. Our first Charles, who, with all his errors as
a king, had the manners and mind of a gentleman,
was so much under its influence, that he never enjoyed
a day's happiness after consulting the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes
Virgilianæ</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>In our age&mdash;an age in many respects enlightened
by the beams of philosophy&mdash;the effects resulting from
credulity, superstition, and fanaticism are dreadful;
but while the evils are contemplated with horror, the
system is too ridiculous for sober reasoning. It induces
the infatuated votary to believe that being in
the pale of a particular church will ensure his salvation.
The ignorant are confounded with metaphysical
subtleties which the wisest cannot comprehend;
and by combining different texts of holy writ, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
are insulted with conclusions contrary to common
sense.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>To check this inundation of absurdity, which deemed
carnal reason profane, and was not to be combated by
argument, Mr. Hogarth engraved this print; it contains
what must ever operate as a complete refutation
of those who, because they were his opponents in
politics, have impudently asserted that he lost his
talents in the decline of life: for though the delineation
was made in his sixty-fourth year, in satire, wit,
and imagination, it is superior to any of his preceding
works.</p>

<p>The text "I speak as a fool" is a type of the
preacher, whose strength of lungs is a convenient
substitute for strength of argument. He is literally a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Boanerges; his tones rend the region, and the thunder
of his eloquence has cracked the sounding-board. His
right hand poises a witch astride upon a broom-stick,
and in his left he suspends an emissary of Satan: this
embryotic demon wields a gridiron as a terror to the
ungodly, and at the witch's breast is an incubus in the
shape of a cat.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Considering action as the first requisite
of an orator, our ecclesiastical juggler throws
his whole frame into convulsions: he shakes as the
lofty cedar in a storm. Like Milton's devil,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"With head, hands, wings, or feet, he works his way,</p>
<p class="verse">And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>By these violent agitations his gown flies open, and
discovers that this Proteus of the pulpit is arrayed in
a Harlequin's jacket; and his wig falling off, displays
the shaven crown of a Jesuit. But the loss of
a periwig is not attended to, his denunciations are
redoubled, his fulminations hurled indiscriminately
around; he scatters about firebrands; and darts,
pointed with destruction, and barbed with death,
pierce the hearts of his terrified hearers. Wrought
up to the highest pitch of seraphic fervour, fevered
by the heat of his own ecstasies,&mdash;the whole man is
inspired,&mdash;and mounted upon the clouds of mystery,
he soars through the dark regions of superstition,
settles in the third heaven, and breathes empyreal air.</p>

<p>The train is fired,&mdash;the contagion spreads, the cup
of delusion is filled to the brim, and each of his infatuated
auditors intoxicated with the fumes of enthusiastic
madness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse5">"Broken each link of reason's chain,</p>
<p class="verse">Witchcraft and magic hold their reign;</p>
<p class="verse">Terror and comfortless despair,</p>
<p class="verse">And fond credulity is there.</p>
<p class="verse">Circling all nature's vast profound,</p>
<p class="verse">Imagination takes her round,</p>

<p class="verse">Thence through the vasty void descends,</p>

<p>With a postboy's cap upon his head, to denote that
he is a special messenger from above, a little cherubimic
Mercury flies through the clouds, and bears in
his mouth an express directed to Saint Money Trapp.</p>

<p>Immediately beneath the pulpit are two lambs of
the flock in an ecstasy. The young man with a round
head of hair is probably a lay preacher; for though
he has not a sable coat, he has a black collar. Piously
entreating a young maiden, who meets his advances
with an holy zeal, he puts the waxen model of a
female saint down her bosom.</p>

<p>In the same pew are two fellows very differently
affected: one of them, with a despairing countenance,
sheds iron tears; the other, like the wet sea-boy on
the mast, sleeps through the terrors of the storm,
though a malignant imp of darkness, envying his
serenity, endeavours to awake him by a whisper,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> that
he also may share such curses as would serve for a
supplement to St. Ernulphus.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Between two duck-winged cherubs, who are studying
the laughing and crying gamut, is the harpy clerk.
This crook-mouthed echo of absurdity, and associate
in villany, has the true physiognomy of a Tartuffe:
every feature is charged with hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The congregation,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> many of whom have been imported
from Liffey's verdant banks, bear their parts
in this enchanting serenade; and the bull roar of the
preacher, combined with a chorus of sighs, groans,
and shrieks, must produce a symphony that might
vie with the Irish howl or Indian war-whoop.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the crowd we discover a youthful convert
under the guidance of his spiritual confessor,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> who,
pointing to Brimstone Ocean, unfolds a tale which
terrifies his disciple to a degree that</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Must harrow up his soul; freeze his young blood;</p>
<p class="verse">Make his two eyes like stars start from their spheres;</p>

<p>The sanguinary Jew, while he leans upon an altar,
on which lies a knife inscribed "bloody," sacrifices to
his revenge an unfortunate insect which he caught
carelessly wandering on the environs of his head.</p>

<p>Beneath is Mrs. Tofts, of Godalming, well known
in the annals of credulity; in the violence of her
paroxysm, she breaks a dram glass with her teeth.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

iron staples.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In his hand he holds a quart bottle,

but the imprisoned sprite forcing the cork,
mounts into the regions of air with a lighted taper
in its hand.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The book on which our sable professor
of necromancy has deposited his basket, is King
James's <cite>Demonology</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> this, with Whitfield's <cite>Journal</cite>,
which lies among the implements of his art, covertly
intimate the sources where he had sought and found
inspiration.</p>

<p>The ridicule is wound up by a Turk, whom we see
through a window smoking his tube of Trinidado;
lifting up his eyes with astonishment at the scene,
he breathes a grateful ejaculation, and thanks his
Maker that he was early initiated in the divine truths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>of the Koran, is out of the pale of this church, and
has his name engraven on the tablets of Mahomet.</p>

<p>As all the decorations which are displayed in this
temple of credulity, superstition, and fanaticism are
suitable to the congregation, the carved figures on
the pulpit are worthy of the preacher. We are in
the first compartment presented with the apparition
which warned Sir George Villiers of the Duke of
Buckingham's danger from the knife of Felton;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> in
the second, with Julius Cæsar's ghost reproaching
Brutus; and in the third, with the ghost of Mrs. Veale,
which appeared to Mrs. Bargrave,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>&mdash;because a very
large impression of <cite>Drelincourt upon Death</cite> lay in the
bookseller's warehouse, and would not move without
a marvellous relation of an apparition.</p>

<p>Beneath is a figure of the Tedworth drummer, who
so wickedly disturbed the family of Mr. Mompesson;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>and in the frame below, a representation of Fanny,
the phantom of Cock Lane, with her hammer in her
right hand. These two notable memorials of credulity
are placed as a kind of headpiece to a mental thermometer,
which ascertains the different degrees of
heat in the blood of an enthusiast. When the liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
ascends, it rises from lukewarm to love-heat,&mdash;ecstasy!
convulsion fits,&mdash;madness,&mdash;and terminates
in raving, which is properly obscured by clouds, and
above the ken of human comprehension. In its falling
state, the progress of religious depression is most accurately
marked. From low spirits it sinks to sorrow,
agony, settled grief, despair, madness,&mdash;suicide! The
whole rests on Wesley's <cite>Sermons</cite>, and Glanville <cite>On
Witches</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>On the preacher's left hand, suspended to a ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
inserted in a human nostril, hangs the scale of vociferation.
A <em>natural tone</em> is at the bottom, but the
<em>speaker's tone</em> is described by the distended mouth
above the scale, crying Blood! blood! blood! and
inscribed "Bull roar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>To the hook of the chandelier hangs a small sphere,
on which is engraven, "Desarts of new Purgatory."
On the globe, out of which spring the branches
for candles, is written, "A globe of hell, as newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
drawn by R&mdash;&mdash;ne" (Romaine). It is so formed as
to give the caricature of a human face, and baptized
"Horrid Zone." Round one of the eyes is inscribed
"The Bottomless Pit;" round the other, "Molten-lead
Lake." On one cheek is "Brimstone Ocean;" on
the other, "Parts Unknown;" and round the mouth,
"Eternal Damnation Gulf." Horribly profane as are
these mottoes, they are mere copies of Tabernacle
phraseology. In the same class comes the hymn,
which is placed before the clerk:</p>

<p>The poor's box is a mouse-trap, which very fairly
intimates that whatever money is deposited will be
secured for the <em>faithful collectors</em>. It may be further
meant to insinuate, that whosoever is caught in this
necromantic snare will be in the state of Sterne's
starling, and cannot get out, for it is planted with
pointed steel, and tears in pieces those who attempt
an escape.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">There are three things of which your
Englishman deems himself the best of all
possible judges: the art of stirring a
fire, religion, and politics. His infallibility in the
first no one will presume to question, except his wife;
and with her he will dispute as long as disputing is
good. The mysteries of the second he understands
better than the Archbishop of Canterbury. As to the
intricacies of the third, which thinking men are apt
to consider in some degree hidden from those who are
not admitted into the arcana, he can unravel them
with more ease, and point out with more precision
what steps ought to be taken, than can the Prime
Minister, with all the aggregate wisdom of the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>So many of his Majesty's good subjects being thus
gifted with an intuitive knowledge of state affairs, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>is no wonder that Britain holds so high a rank among
the nations; for each act of government is stated and
debated, not only in the two Houses of Parliament,
but in every tavern, coffeehouse, and porter-house in
the metropolis.</p>

<p>To these eloquent leaders of the numerous clubs,
we may add a myriad of political writers, who are all
but inspired. Without studying either Machiavel,
Locke, or Sidney, they pour forth a torrent of
lucubrations on the floating subjects of the hour;
that hour past, their letters, replies, remarks, and
rejoinders are heard of no more.</p>

<p>In the hope of giving their puny offspring a longer
life, some of these learned Thebans, or their booksellers,
called in the aid of artists, to adorn their
labours with <em>taking</em> frontispieces. These graphic
ornaments were in general about as <em>lively</em> as the
pamphlets they decorated; and it was found that the
united efforts of author, printer, painter, engraver, and
publisher, could not ensure immortality. Notwithstanding
this general failure in their intended operation,
they had one very awkward effect. A sort of
political influenza was communicated to our engravers,
and they also became deep statesmen and profound
politicians. While part of this band sharpened their
burins, and defaced much good copper in caricaturing
the members of administration, their opponents were
equally industrious, and equally pointed, in <em>taking off</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the <em>honourable gentlemen</em> on the other side of the
house.</p>

<p>The buzzing of these insects of a day was little
attended to: their dulness preserved them from
laughter, their weakness protected them from resentment;
they excited no passion except contempt.</p>

<p>Very different was the public expectation when it
was found that Hogarth intended to publish a series
of political prints. From his former productions they
knew his powers, and considered him as able to throw
any party into ridicule. That which he was expected
to attack dreaded the strength of his aquafortis,
which they apprehended would have the effect of a
caustic, not only on his copper, but on the objects of
his satire.</p>

<p>Previous to the publication of "The Times," Mr.
Wilkes, who was then at Aylesbury, was informed
that the print was political, and that Lord Temple,
Mr. Pitt, Mr. Churchill, and himself, were the leading
characters held up to ridicule. Under the impression
which this intelligence conveyed, he sent Mr. Hogarth
a remonstrance, stating the ungenerous tendency of
such a proceeding; which would be more glaringly
unfriendly, as the two last-mentioned gentlemen and
the artist had always lived upon terms of strict
intimacy. This produced a reply, in which Hogarth
asserted that neither Mr. Wilkes nor Mr. Churchill
were introduced, but Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and the print should be published in a few days. To
this it was answered, that Mr. Wilkes would hardly
deem it worth while to notice any reflections on himself;
but if his friends were attacked, it would wound
him in the most sensible part, and, well as he was
able, he should revenge their cause. This was a
direct declaration of war: the black flag was hoisted
on both sides, and never did two angry men of their
abilities throw mud with less dexterity.</p>

<p>"The Times" was soon after published, and on the
Saturday following, in No. 17 of the <cite>North Briton</cite>, a
most unmerciful attack was directed against the King's
Serjeant Painter. Since that period, marvellous have
been the variations of the patriotic needle; the
Colonel of the Buckinghamshire Militia has filled the
first offices in the city of London, and is now become
chamberlain. Having in these situations seen the
errors of his former politics, he would, I must think,
be the first to acknowledge that the attack was not
only unmerciful, but in many respects unjust. The
hand of time having worn down political asperities, I
hope&mdash;I believe&mdash;Mr. Wilkes will have no objection
to this nettle, forced in the hotbed of a party, being
plucked from that hallowed sod which covers the dust
of William Hogarth.</p>

<p>Should the artist and the chamberlain meet in
Elysium, why may they not drink oblivion to former
feuds in a glass of Lethe? The chamberlain would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
I fancy, prefer champagne; but when a gentleman
travels in a strange country, he must take up with
such beverage as the place affords.</p>

<p>The attack commences with a ridicule of the
<cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>, or rather of Hogarth's honesty
in acknowledging that he was indebted to a friend
for a third part of the wording. The artist was
sensible of his own strength; but what is much more
rare, he was conscious of his own weakness. He knew
the principles of his art; but not being accustomed to
explaining them with a pen, very prudently asked
the aid of those who were, to give his ideas such
language as would render them worthy public attention.
This was at least honest; but as the author
of the <cite>North Briton</cite> presents us with only part of the
apology, let us do the artist justice by inserting the
whole.</p>

<p>After some leading remarks on the system which it
was his wish to establish, he continues as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But observing in the fore-mentioned controversies
that the torrent generally ran against me, and that
several of my opponents had turned my arguments
into ridicule, yet were daily availing themselves of their
use, and venting them even to my face as their own, I
began to wish the publication of something on this
subject; and accordingly applied myself to several
of my friends, whom I thought capable of taking up
the pen for me, offering to furnish them with materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by word of mouth. But finding this method not practicable,
from the difficulty of one man's expressing
the ideas of another, especially on a subject which he
was either unacquainted with, or was new in its kind,
I was therefore reduced to an attempt of finding such
words as would best answer my own ideas, being
now too far engaged to drop the design. Hereupon,
having digested the matter as well as I could, and
thrown it into the form of a book, I submitted it to
the judgment of such friends whose sincerity and
abilities I could best rely on, determining on their
approbation or dislike to publish or destroy it. But
their favourable opinion of the manuscript being publicly
known, it gave such a credit to the undertaking
as soon changed the countenances of those who had
a better opinion of my pencil than my pen, and turned
their sneers into expectation, especially when the
same friends had kindly made me an offer of conducting
the work through the press; and here I must acknowledge
myself particularly indebted to one gentleman
for his corrections and amendments of at least
a third part of the wording. Through his absence
and avocation, several sheets went to the press without
any assistance, and the rest had the occasional
inspection of one or two friends. If any inaccuracies
shall be found in the writing, I shall readily acknowledge
them all my own, and am, I confess, under no
great concern about them, provided the matter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
general may be useful and answerable, in the application
of it, to truth and to nature; in which material
points if the reader shall think fit to rectify any
mistakes, it will give me a sensible pleasure, and be
doing great honour to the work."&mdash;<cite>Preface to Analysis</cite>,
p. 20, edit of 1772.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite>North Briton</cite> continues: "We all
titter the instant he takes up a pen, but we tremble
when we see the pencil in his hand."</p>

<p>As this essay was written in consequence of the
artist giving a pictured shape, it seems rather extraordinary
that so good a logician as Mr. Wilkes should
drag in Hogarth's pen merely to titter at, and acknowledge
that he trembles at his pencil, which instrument,
by the way, drew forth this paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will do him the justice to say, that he possesses
the rare talent of gibbeting in colours, and that in
most of his works he has been a very good moral
satirist." That he has, it is most true. "His forte is
there, and he should have kept it. When he has at
any time deviated from his own peculiar walk, he
has never failed to make himself perfectly ridiculous.
I need only make my appeal to any one of his historical
or portrait pieces, which are now considered
as almost beneath all criticism."</p>

<p><em>Some</em> of his portraits might have been exempted
from this censure: what does Mr. Wilkes think of
Captain Coram, now in the Foundling Hospital?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"The favourite 'Sigismunda,' the labour of so
many years, the boasted effort of his art, was not
human. If the figure had a resemblance of anything
ever on earth, or had the least pretence to
meaning or expression, it was what he had seen, or
perhaps made, in real life, his own wife in an agony
of passion, but of what passion no connoisseur could
guess."</p>

<p>After asserting that the figure was not human,
this is rather too much! From any gentleman, the
daughter of Sir James Thornhill had a claim to more
politeness; but that so gallant a man as Colonel
Wilkes&mdash;a perfect knight-errant in all that related
to the sex&mdash;should make an estimable and respectable
woman a party "in the poor politics of the day, and
descend to low personal abuse" (I use his own language),
because her husband had in these poor politics
adopted an opposite creed, excites astonishment!</p>

<p>Had this transaction passed in the year 1791, instead
of the year 1762, it would have been less extraordinary;
for, alas,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"The days of chivalry are no more."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>"All his friends remember what tiresome discourses
were held by him, day after day, about the transcendent
merit of this 'Sigismunda,' and how the great
names of Raphael, Vandyke, and others, were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to yield the palm of beauty, grace, expression, etc. to
him, for this long-laboured yet uninteresting single
figure. The value he himself set on this, as well as
on some other of his works, almost exceeds belief;
yet from politeness, or fear, or some other motives,
he has actually been paid the most astonishing sums,
as the price, not of his merit, but of his unbounded
vanity."</p>

<p>That the artist demanded too high a price for his
painting of "Sigismunda," I am free to acknowledge;
but it has not been peculiar to Mr. Hogarth to mistake
his talents, and overrate his worst performances.
Mr. Wilkes must know that Milton, and many other
great men, have erred in the same way. I do not
think that "Sigismunda" was worth what he required;
but that he has actually been paid the most
astonishing sums for his other pictures, as the price,
not of his merit, but of his unbounded vanity, I am
yet to learn. The remuneration he received for many
of his works is to be found in these volumes; it was
seldom in any degree equal to their merits. The
painter is no more, but several of his pictures remain;
and were the "Marriage à la Mode," "Rake's
Progress," etc., now upon sale, the present age would,
I am persuaded, sanction my opinion, and the pictures
produce much more astonishing sums than were
originally paid to the artist.</p>

<p>"He has succeeded very happily in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
humour, and has miscarried in every other attempt;
this has arisen in some measure from his head, but
much more from his heart. After 'Marriage à la
Mode,' the public wished for a series of prints of a
Happy Marriage. Hogarth made the attempt; but
the rancour and malevolence of his mind made him
soon turn away with envy and disgust from objects of
so pleasing contemplation, to dwell, and feast a bad
heart, on others of a hateful cast, which he pursued,
for he found them congenial, with the most unabating
zeal and unrelenting gall."</p>

<p>Should any one assert that the strength of colouring,
and astonishing powers, which gave the name of
Churchill so exalted a rank among satirists, originated
in malevolence and rancour, and that he could not
write a panegyric because he delighted in feasting a
bad heart on a bad theme, Mr. Wilkes would, I am
certain, be the first to defend him from such an
aspersion.</p>

<p>That he did not succeed in an attempt to delineate
a Happy Marriage, I can readily believe. Hogarth
was a painter of manners as they were, not as they
ought to be. He considered nature in the abstract,
and usually adhered to what he saw. Among those
friends with whom Hogarth lived in habits of intimacy,
and whose domestic situations he had the best
opportunity of studying,&mdash;though Mr. Churchill and
the Colonel were of the number,&mdash;he might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
know a family from whence such a scene could be
copied.</p>

<p>"I have observed some time his setting sun. He
has long been very dim, and almost shorn of his
beams."</p>

<p>For a confirmation of the above assertion, see the
print of "The Medley," published this very year. My
opinion of it the reader is already in possession of,
and that opinion corresponds with an authority which,
I believe, even Mr. Wilkes will consider as very high:&mdash;"For
useful and deep satire, 'The Medley' is the
most sublime of all Hogarth's works."&mdash;<em>Walpole.</em></p>

<p>"He seems so conscious of this (<em>i.e.</em> that his sun is
setting, etc.) that he now glimmers with borrowed light.
'John Bull's house in flames' has been hackneyed in
fifty different prints; and if there is any merit in the
figure on stilts, and the mob prancing around, it is
not to be ascribed to Hogarth, but to Callot."</p>

<p>Callot's was, I acknowledge, the first thought, but
Sir Joshua Reynolds will tell Mr. Wilkes that happy
appropriation is not plagiarism.</p>

<p>"I own, too, that I am grieved to see the genius of
Hogarth, which should take in all ages and countries,
sunk to a level with the miserable tribe of party-etchers,
and now in his rapid decline entering into the
poor politics of the faction of the day, and descending
into low personal abuse, instead of instructing the
world, as he could once, by manly moral satire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>I too am grieved that Hogarth, or any other man
of talents, should descend to the poor politics of the
faction of the day. But be it remarked, that this
was the first political print he designed; and if so
contemptible as it was before stated to be, it is rather
singular that this one little satire, the first he engraved
on the subject, and "destitute of every kind of original
merit, in every part confused, perplexed, and embarrassed,
where the story is not well told to the
eye, and where we cannot discover the faintest ray
of genius," should excite so warm a resentment.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkes goes on to ask, "Whence can proceed
so surprising a change? Is it from the frowardness of
old age? or is it that envy and impatience of resplendent
merit in every way, at which he has always
sickened? How often has he been remarked to droop
at the fair and honest applause given even to a friend?"
etc.</p>

<p>I am told, by those who lived in habits of intimacy
with Mr. Hogarth&mdash;never! But let us remember, that
what is deemed fair and honest applause by the person
who receives it, may by an impartial spectator be
thought more than he is entitled to.</p>

<p>"It is sufficient that the rest of mankind applaud;
from that moment he begins the attack, and you never
can be well with him, till he hears an universal outcry
against you, and till all your friends have given you
up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>That Hogarth should have wished to render a man
infamous in the eyes of society, before he would admit
him to the honour of his regards, is a paradox I
cannot solve. I believe this kind of preparation for
friendship was never practised by any other person,
of any age or country.</p>

<p>"The public had never the least share of Hogarth's
regard, or even goodwill. Gain and vanity have
steered his little bark quite through life. He has
never been consistent but with respect to these two
principles."</p>

<p>Hogarth was no hypocrite. By the word "public,"
is frequently meant that party who are immersed in
the violent factions of the day. For them he never
professed goodwill. But if by the public is meant
society in its various branches and different ranks,
almost all his works had as great a tendency to
make the world wiser and better, as had those of
men who made more violent professions. His little
bark having been steered through life by gain and
vanity, I hardly know how to understand. He lived
a long and laborious life; he was admitted to be
the first, the very first, in his walk; and died worth
a sum that a Jew broker will acquire before breakfast.
As to vanity,&mdash;of talents superior to any other artist,&mdash;he
had a right to be vain.</p>

<p>"But all genius was not born, nor will it die, with
Mr. Hogarth; and notwithstanding all his ungenerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
efforts to damp or chill it in another, I will trust to a
discerning and liberal spirit in the English nation to
patronize and reward all real merit. It will in the
end rise superior to the idle laugh of the hour," etc.</p>

<p>Of this discerning and liberal spirit there is not
a stronger instance than the estimation in which
Hogarth's works, not excepting the <cite>Analysis</cite> (however
it may be worded), are held thirty years after
the publication of the <cite>North Briton</cite>.</p>

<p>"In the year 1746, when the Guards were ordered
to march to Finchley on the most important service
they could be employed in,&mdash;the extinguishing a
Scottish rebellion which threatened the entire ruin of
the illustrious family on the throne, and, in consequence,
of our liberties,&mdash;Mr. Hogarth came out with a
print to make them ridiculous<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> to their countrymen,
and to all Europe; or, perhaps, it rather was to tell the
Scots, in his way, how little the Guards were to be
feared, and that they might safely advance. That the
ridicule might not stop here, and that it might be as
offensive as possible to his own sovereign, he dedicated
the print to the King of Prussia, as an encourager of
arts. Is this patriotism? In old Rome, or in any of
the Grecian States, he would have been punished as a
profligate citizen, totally devoid of all principle."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>These are heavy charges; but mark how a plain
tale shall put them down. From the effects which
are described as likely to result from this most seditious
print, we are tempted to think it must have
been designed, etched, engraved, printed off, and dispersed
with so much expedition as to arrive in Scotland
before the Guards whom it holds up to ridicule;
for one of its designs was "to tell the Scots, in his
way, how little the Guards were to be feared, and that
they might safely advance." The march was in 1746,
and the publication of this print in 1750; therefore<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
it could not have these most direful and dangerous
effects! That he dedicated it to the King of
Prussia, as an encourager of arts, is true; but this
dedication was not inserted until another had been
rejected, because it was misunderstood by the King
of England; and George the Second, with all his
virtues, was neither a judge of humour nor an encourager
of the arts. These premises granted, I
think we may fairly draw this conclusion: Had old
Hogarth been a citizen of old Rome, or a member
of any of the Grecian States, and published such a
representation of his own times, he would not have
been punished as a profligate citizen: he would
neither have been flagellated, impaled, decollated, nor
thrown from the Tarpeian rock; but his print would
have been laughed at by every member of the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
who had the least ray of humour, though&mdash;as in
some cases that we have seen&mdash;the length of a grave
orator's beard might hide the risible emotions of his
muscles, and the amplitude of his robe conceal the
shaking of his sides.</p>

<p>To detail the conclusion of this paper, about the
dishonour of his being appointed pannel-painter to
the King, never suffered to caricature any of the royal
family, etc., is scarcely necessary. If the appointment
was less respectable than his merits demanded, the
disgrace did not fall upon him; but be it remarked,
that the office was afterwards held by Sir Joshua
Reynolds; and however elevated his taste, however
superior his talents, his genius was long distinguished
and admired by the public before he had
the honour of taking the portraits of their Majesties.</p>

<p>Trusting that Hogarth's own works will sufficiently
ascertain his character, I shall not attempt his further
vindication, but proceed to the print.</p>

<p>A globe, which must here be considered as the
world, though it appears to be no more than a tavern
sign, is represented on fire, and Mr. Pitt, exalted on

adoration. From the neck of this idol of the populace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
is suspended a millstone, on which is inscribed
£3000 per annum, allusive to his pension, and intimating
that so ponderous a load must in time sink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his popularity.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> While he is thus increasing the
conflagration, a number of Highlanders,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> grenadiers,
sailors, etc., are busily working a fire-engine to extinguish
it. The pipe is guided by a Union Office
fireman at the top. Defended by an iron cap, and
decorated with a badge inscribed "G. R.," this intrepid
engineer pays no regard to three streams of
water which are furiously driven at his rear from the
windows of the Temple Coffeehouse. The Liliputian
engines, through which these tiny showers descend,
are directed by a nobleman and two garretteers. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>inscription over the door determines the title of the
former, who is delineated without features: the two
gentlemen in the attic were, I believe, originally
intended for Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Churchill, but
previous to publication the faces were altered.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A

candle in his hat, and a large knife in his pocket;
thus intimating that he is ready either to fire a city
or murder a citizen. Mounted to the situation he
now occupies by a ladder, he is drawing up a sign
of the Patriot's Arms, and in this good work is
assisted by two strong-sinewed coadjutors, who are
dragging the ropes to which it is suspended. The

other; the date, 1762.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> This curious delineation will

to be impeded by a fellow with a wheelbarrow full

intended as a representative of the Duke of Newcastle,
endeavours to overset the Scot, and burst the

<p>Wholly engrossed by avarice, the crafty Dutchman,

<p>Close to him is a patriotic trumpeter, blowing the
spirit-stirring tube, and pointing to a show-cloth, on
which is painted a wild Indian. By the magisterial
robe in which this trumpeter is arrayed, and the city
arms on the banner of his windy instrument, he is decisively
intended to personify Mr. Alderman Beckford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
thrice Lord Mayor of London. Beneath the savage
to whom he points, is written, "Alive from America."
This grotesque figure is placed before two tobacco
hogsheads, grasps in each hand a purse inscribed
"£1000," and has tied round him, so as to form a
sort of Indian dress, eight or ten little bags equally
well filled. His countenance leads us to judge that
he delights in the devastation by which he is a gainer;
and seems to imply that our American brethren, like
our Amsterdam allies, were eager to furnish friend or
foe with the product of their respective countries. It
may further intimate the Alderman's immense riches,
and that a leading article of his trade was tobacco.</p>

<p>A table clock, inscribed "Airs by Harrington,"
representing a company of soldiers in a regular
march, has an evident allusion to the military doctrine
of man being a machine. "The Norfolk jig,
G. T. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fecit</i>," hints at the Norfolk Militia, and Mr.
George Townshend, who paid unremitting attention
to the discipline and appearance of the corps raised
in Norfolk.</p>

<p>"The Post Office," painted on a cracked board
fastened against the wall, may possibly signify the
office of Postmaster-General being then divided.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>In the opposite corner of the print, surrounded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
his miserable and famished subjects, sits the heroic
Frederick of Prussia. Regardless of their distress, and
unmoved by their cries, tears, and execrations&mdash;like
Nero, who fiddled while Rome burnt&mdash;he is lost to
every feeling, except those which arise from the fine
tones of his Cremona. The effects resulting from his
insatiable thirst of glory are not confined to his own
subjects. Fired by vaulting ambition, he scatters
destruction through surrounding states; depopulates
provinces, and lays waste kingdoms, to prove himself&mdash;a
philosopher.</p>

<p>How far the rest of the figures in this group may
refer to particular persons or nations, I cannot determine.
The female, with clasped hands and eyes
raised to heaven, has been supposed to be intended
for the Empress Queen; a venerable matron, stealing
away with a trunk under her arm, for the late Empress
of Russia, Frederick's most inveterate enemy,
who ended her earthly reign on the 2d of January
1762. They may be so intended, though I must
acknowledge I do not discover anything which will
wholly establish the supposition, but am more inclined
to consider them as merely exemplifying the horrors
of war.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i> hung from one of the houses in
flames, and the black eagle from the other, sufficiently
indicate the powers intended to be pointed out. The
sign of the Salutation alludes to the treaty between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
France and Spain, for the dexter figure is Louis
Baboon; and the sinister, Lord Strut.</p>

<p>The flames rage with so much violence as to prevent
the fluttering dove from alighting on any of the
buildings; notwithstanding which, this bird of peace,
with an olive branch, hovers over them in the midst
of ascending smoke.</p>

<p>The exact point of time is determined by the
waggon, inscribed "Hermione," in the background.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Such is my general idea of the preceding plate;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>there may be those who will discover many things
which I do not see, and which possibly never entered
into the contemplation of the artist. As the whole
alludes to the politics of his own day, all the characters
introduced were his contemporaries, and several
of them had been his intimate friends, he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
intentionally leave some parts obscure;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> or conceiving
his meaning sufficiently obvious to those who lived at
the time, forget that it would become impervious to
posterity.</p>

<p>I have before observed that in allegory he was not
happy; and the dissimilar combinations here brought
together are a proof of the assertion. Soldiers and
sailors, whose business it is to increase the flames of
war, carrying water to extinguish them, is not quite
consonant to our general ideas of their dispositions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Highlanders, being universally considered as the soldiers
of Europe, make but an awkward appearance in
the character of peacemakers.</p>

<p>A sign of the globe on fire, flames bursting out of
the Globe Tavern and three other buildings, with
each an alehouse sign, to explain what nations are
meant, borders upon the bathos. Another nation
personified by the sovereign fiddling to his expiring
subjects, is not a bad thought, but here it is incongruous.
It has not that general unison with the other
parts of the picture which either writing or painting
demands. Separated from the accompaniments, this
group might have made a good print; with the
Globe Tavern, the Temple Coffeehouse, the garretteers,
and the aldermen, it does not assimilate.</p>

<p>My last remark I shall take the liberty of borrowing
from Mr. Wilkes, for in this one point I have the
honour of agreeing with him: "The print is too much
crowded with figures."</p>

<div class="caption">THE TIMES. PLATE II.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A painter engaging in the political disputes of his
day, is in a situation similar to a gentleman beginning
to rebuild a family mansion. The pencil of one,
dipped in these troubled streams, or the fingers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the other but touch-brick and mortar,&mdash;it is not in the
tables of De Moivre to calculate the conclusion of their
labours. Each of them sets out upon a certain plan,
determines that he will go so far, and no further: but
the gentleman is induced to make a first addition to
his original plan, because it will be more convenient;
a second, because it will be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnifique</i>; and a third
and fourth <em>must be</em>, because without them the building
will not be uniform.</p>

<p>The artist engraves a political print, which raises
an host of enemies, who buzz about him like a nest
of disturbed hornets. To them, wording not being
the painter's province, he replies by a second print,
which produces a second volume of abuse; "another
and another still succeeds," and he must either sink
under this load of obloquy, or devote the residue of
his days to the defence of his character. Such at
least was the political progress of Hogarth.</p>

<p>By his first print of "The Times" he roused two
very formidable adversaries, and they treated him
with as much ceremony as two deputies from the
Bow Street magistrates would an incendiary or an
assassin. They did not consider him as a man
whose conduct it was needful to investigate, or whose
opinions it was necessary to confute, but as a criminal,
whose aggravated crimes had outraged every law
of society, and whom they would therefore drag to the
place of execution. To defend himself from these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>furious assailants, he had no shield but a copperplate,
no weapons but a pencil and a burin. The use
he made of them may be seen in the two last prints;
but though this was engraved during the time of
the contest, it was not published while he lived.
Whether a sudden change in politics, a supposed
ambiguity in part of his design, or the advice of
judicious or timid friends, induced him to suppress
his work, cannot now be ascertained; but whatever
were the reasons, his widow's respect for his memory
induced her to adopt the same conduct. She retained
a reverence for even the dust of her husband, and
dreaded its being raked from the sepulchre where
he had been quietly inurned, mixed with the poisonous
aconite of party, and by sacrilegious hands cast
into the agitated cauldron of politics. If we add to
this the specimen of political candour which she had
experienced in her own person, can we wonder that
she cautiously avoided whatever could be tortured
into a provocation to the renewal of hostilities? From
these considerations she never suffered more than one
impression to be taken, and that was struck off at the
earnest request of Lord Exeter.</p>

<p>In withholding this plate from the public she acted
prudently; in attempting to describe it, I may be
thought to act otherwise. To enter into a discrimination
of characters who now live, "or step upon
ashes which are not yet cold," is liable to invidious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
construction. Let it be remembered, that though I
have endeavoured to point out the characters delineated
by Hogarth, it does not follow that my
explanation will always be right.</p>

<p>Though several of the figures are marked in a
style so obtrusive that they cannot be mistaken,
there are others where I can only guess at the originals.
From those who were engaged in the politics
of that day I have sought information, but their
communications have been neither important nor
consistent with each other. They generally ended in
an acknowledgment, that "in thirty years they had
forgotten much which they once knew, and which, if
now recollected, would materially elucidate." To
this was added what I am compelled to admit, that
parts of the print are obscure. I have before
observed that neither politics nor allegory were
Hogarth's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</i>, and this delineation was made under
the impression of resentment.</p>

<p>The exact time of its being engraved I cannot
positively ascertain, but conjecture it must have been
some time in the year 1762. A small part of the sky
was left unfinished, and in that state still remains, as
the present proprietors would not suffer any other engraver
to draw a line on the copperplate of Hogarth.</p>

<p>On a pedestal in the centre of the print is a statue
of the present King in his coronation robes, inscribed
"A Ramsay delt;" his right hand is placed on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
side, and the left leans upon a plummet, which seems
to have been Mr. Ramsay's guide in the delineation;
for the drapery is in squares, decided as the ground
glass stopper of a decanter, and the whole figure is
composed of straight lines. Of these upright figures
Hogarth had given his opinion in the <cite>Analysis</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and
Mr. Ramsay being portrait-painter to his Majesty, a
post Hogarth thought himself better qualified to fill,
he took this opportunity of throwing his manner into
ridicule.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The head of a lion in <em>bas relief</em> with a
leaden pipe in his mouth,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> being on the front of the
pedestal, intimates its connection with a reservoir;
and the royal statue on the top denotes this to be the
fountain of honour. The able-bodied figure turning
a fire-plug is evidently intended for Lord Bute; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>employment seems to intimate that he has the power
of accelerating or retarding the stream of royal
bounty, and wheresoever he willeth it shall flow,
there it floweth. A baronial escutcheon, keys, stars,
coronets, croziers, mitres, maces, lie close to the
pedestal, around which are placed a number of garden
pots with shrubs. Two rose trees most plentifully
sprinkled by streams from the fountain of favour
have been originally inscribed "James <span class="fs80">III.</span>;" but
James being now blotted out, George is put above it,
and by a little hyphen beneath the lowest figure,
marked as belonging to the lowest line. Three
orange trees have the initials "G. R.," and beneath
the letters is inscribed "Republican." These also
receive drops of favour; but a large laurel planted
in a capacious vase, raised upon the base of a pillar,
and inscribed "Culloden," is watered by the dew of
heaven,&mdash;by a copious shower poured from the urn
of Aquarius. Besides these six flourishing plants,
there are a number of yew and box trees, clipped
into true taste by a Dutch gardener. Some of them
retain their old situations, but an active labourer
is busily clearing the grounds of all these ancient
formalities. Many of them he has already wheeled
out of their places, and thrown into the ditch that
surrounds the platform, into which situation he is
now tumbling two venerable box trees of a most
orderly and regular cut: each of them having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
letters G. R., may apply to the favourites either of
George the First or Second. This I suppose is
meant to express, by an allegorical figure, the great
number of old place-men who resigned on the accession
of his present Majesty.</p>

<p>The late Henry Fox, afterwards Lord Holland,
being at that time a leading character in the House
of Commons, and deemed the partisan of Lord Bute,
is here represented as removing these antiquated
plants from the vivifying hothouse of royalty to the
cold and dank ditch of despair. Hogarth, not thinking
a sable countenance and ebon eyebrows would
sufficiently indicate the person meant, has given the
outline of a fox's head to his cap. In his reforming
business he is somewhat impeded by a garden roller,
on which is written "£1,000,000,000," meaning possibly
the national debt. On the platform lies a
broom, shovel, and rake, necessary implements in
clearing gardens; and in the surrounding <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fosse</i> such
a collection of fantastic <em>nevergreens</em>, as decked the
pleasure-grounds of our ancient sovereigns, "trimm'd
with nice art," and cut into the shapes of pyramids,
fortifications, globes, and birds. On one of them,
clipped into the form of a human head, is a mask,
well expressing the taste of our ancestors.</p>

<p>It is observable that Lord Bute and Mr. Henry
Fox are the only persons on the platform: one of
these gentlemen was, I believe, supposed to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
highest confidence of his sovereign; and the other,
a most powerful influence over the people's representatives.</p>

<p>A group in the dexter corner is principally made
up of members of the Upper House. A senatorial
figure in the chair under the king's arms is intended
for Sir John Cust, then Speaker. That beneath him,
wiping his forehead, evidently from perturbation of
mind, for William Duke of Cumberland. Below him
is Lord Mansfield, and still lower Lord Temple,
presenting his snuff-box to his Grace of Newcastle,
who had a short time before joined the opposition.
We also recognise Earl Winchelsea, and George
Doddington, afterwards Lord Melcombe.</p>

<p>Who are intended to be hinted at by a number
of persons asleep, I do not know: it, however, proves
that there were at that period men who were not
to be kept awake by the most important interests
of their country. Had this print borne relation to
the orators of 1790 instead of the speakers of 1762,
there would have been no cause for astonishment.
Considering the hour at which our present race of
senators meet to do business, and that one oration
frequently lasts from the twilight of evening to the
crowing of the cock, could it excite wonder if half
the assembly were under the dominion of Somnus
before what one of our fashionable prints so familiarly
calls the peroration?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other side of a rail, intended, I believe, to
divide the Commons from the Lords, are a number
of figures firing at the emblem of Peace, which is
fluttering in the air near the signs of the zodiac. Mr.
Pitt we are enabled to identify, not only by his
features, but by his gouty legs. His gun has much
the longest barrel, and while he fires it off he prudently
turns away his face, fearing a flash in the pan
may scorch his eyebrows; or perhaps acting as a
waterman, looking one way and rowing another. A
figure behind him discharges a blunderbuss; and in
the sinister hand of one immediately before him is
a horse-pistol. The household artillery of all the
band (and from the smoke which is diffused over the
centre of the group it appears they are numerous)
is directed to the same object. One prudent personage,
a little before Mr. Pitt, seems to be in the
act of desertion; for though yet seated on the gunpowder
bench, he has got his head under the rail,
and is half on the other side. This may be pointed
at one of that class who go under the denomination
of Trimmers, or may intimate that the gentleman
is in the way of getting a place or a peerage; but
what is his name, or was his future title, I am not
enough read in the red book<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> to determine. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
next figure resembles Henry Bilson Legge. A hand
with an ear-trumpet may perhaps allude to Lord
Chesterfield, whose deafness was at this period proverbial.
Two figures above him are distinguished,
one by a muff, and the other by a pair of spectacles;
"to whom related, or by whom begot," baffles my
conjecture: the lowest figure has a resemblance to
the first Lord Holland, but <em>he</em> is exhibited on the
platform. A dog immediately behind Lord Bute,
having his eye fixed on the urn of Aquarius, I suppose
to be barking at the shower which pours on the
laurel inscribed "Culloden." He is a Caledonian
cur, and on his collar is written the word "Mercy,"
allusive, perhaps, to the cruelties said to have been
exercised in Scotland in 1745, which accounts for
the natives of that country thinking the Duke had
more liberal rewards and more distinguished honours
than he fairly merited.</p>

<p>Thus much must suffice for the dignified personages
who then drove the state machine: to regret that I
cannot point out more of the characters would be
useless. I am not deeply studied in the political
history of that day; to those who are, must be delegated
the task of more particular explanation.</p>

<p>The two most distinguished persons in the opposite
group are exalted to the pillory. Over a figure of
Fanny the Phantom, who is dressed in a white sheet,
the engraver has written "Conspiracy." In one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
she holds a small hammer, and in the other a lighted
taper, with which she sets fire to a <cite>North Briton</cite> that
is fastened on the breast of Esquire Wilkes, above
whose head is written "Defamation." The patriot is
depicted with a most rueful countenance and empty
pockets. On the steps below are such a company as
we generally see assembled on these great occasions.
Two Highlanders, one of whom is grasping a purse,
and with most significant grin pointing to the <em>profane
cheeld</em> who had dared to abuse his clan, and
reprinted Howell's <cite>Description of Scotland</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> by his
belt and lapels he appears to be military, and is perhaps
meant for Colonel Martin. Close to him is a
Liliputian chimney-sweeper, and a fellow blowing a
cow's horn with force that gives a Boreas-like distension
to his cheeks.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> This resounding clangour is
softened by the cheering notes of the sweet-sounding
violin, while the growling bagpipe gives a thorough
bass to the whole. Still further to keep up the spirits
of the company, a woman is retailing gin from a keg
inscribed with the two initials "J. W.," and a schoolboy
amusing himself, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Teniers</i>, with Mr. Wilkes'
shoes. To complete his degradation, the Bishop's
Abigail so skilfully trundles her well-soaked mop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>that he enjoys the full benefit of her mud-coloured
drops.</p>

<p>The group behind is partly made up of British
sailors and soldiers, each of whom exhibit a most
melancholy spectacle of the fortune of war. One
lion-hearted veteran, having had both legs and arms
lopped off in the service of his country, has his oak-like
trunk borne to the borders of the platform upon
a porter's knot,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> where, with three other disabled warriors,
he waits in the hope of catching a few drops
from the fountain of honour; but alas! the stream
which ascends from a fire-plug behind the gate falls
on the heads of a mob who are in the background.
Some of these may possibly be cripples, for a crutch
as well as several bludgeons is flourished in the air.
At a window, over which is painted "Dr. Cant's," and
"Man Midwife," a bishop is confirming two adults by
the imposition of hands. Whether by this representation
the artist intended to hint that this father of
the church confirmed them in their political errors,
the reader must determine according to his political
creed; but thus far we may venture to decide, Doctor
Thomas Seeker, then Archbishop of Canterbury, was
the person intended to be delineated. At the rooms
where the Society for Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures,
and Commerce then met, a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
persons, by the help of a crane, are dragging up a
large silver palette, on which is written "Premium."
The man instructing the workmen is, I believe,
intended for Mr. Peter Templeman, then Secretary to
the Society; as one of the figures in the first floor is
probably Lord Romney, then their President.</p>

<p>Behind this we discover the New Church in the
Strand; and on the opposite side a triumphal column;
a structure with the word "Hospital" inscribed on the
front, and a scaffolding, with workmen completing
a very large new building. These, I apprehend,
Hogarth intended as descriptive of the great things
which were to be undertaken and carried on during
the reign of a monarch who gloried in the name
of Briton. That the workmen and scaffolding bear
allusion to those extensive and ponderous premises
now known by the name of Somerset Place, there can
be little doubt: the artist, with an eye of prophetic
anticipation, has placed his scaffolding nearly on the
spot where the building now stands;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and conscious
of the time it must take to pile up such a quantity of
stone, has not represented it built, but building.</p>

<p>The figure of Lord Bute is a strong likeness, and
in the turn of head very similar to Ramsay's portrait
which Mr. Ryland engraved. Pointing out the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Lord Holland by making the outline of his cap in
the form of a fox's head, is a whimsical idea. Even
the sculptured lion's shaggy front has strong markings.
He is by no means pleased with the distribution of
those honours that he is made a party in bestowing,
but goes through his business with a very wry face.
To the poor maimed sailors and soldiers, Callot could
not have given much more spirit. Though upon so
small a scale, they have all the hardihood of their
order; and both in them and the elevated party<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> on
the opposite side, variety and distinction of character
is accurately and nicely discriminated.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">The bitter satire upon Hogarth's domestic
habits, talents, taste, originality, and orthography,
which has been before noticed,
would have discomposed a less irritable man, and
warranted any retaliation in the power of the pencil;
but he seems to have felt little uneasiness, and under
a conviction that the overcharged blunderbuss which
had been aimed at him had burst in the explosion
and wounded his assailant more than himself, did not
think it necessary to point fire-arms at an adversary
whose intemperate zeal had defeated his avowed purpose.
Under the influence of these impressions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
artist has not attempted to be severe; nor can I comprehend
upon what ground this plate has been denominated
a satire, for it is not a caricature, but a very
accurate and striking resemblance, with the identical
accompaniments which I most firmly believe Mr.
Wilkes would at that time have chosen as the decorations
of his portrait. The cap of liberty, "Heaven-descended,
godlike liberty," above his head, and two
political papers which he acknowledged himself to
have written, on his right hand. One of these papers
is marked with that memorable number, which was
in its day a kind of shibboleth to the party.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> On the
same table with the two <cite>North Britons</cite> is a pen and
ink, importing that the person delineated is an author,
a character the Colonel could hardly be ashamed of.
These premises granted to the artist,&mdash;and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The very head and front of his offending</p>
<p class="verse">Hath this extent, no more,"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">what crime has he committed? He has given an
engraving, which cannot indeed be considered as a
compliment, because it is not a flattering likeness; but
I do not see why it should have been received as a
sarcasm. If we add to this the time when, and place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>where, it was taken; if we consider how glorious the
situation!&mdash;how interesting the moment!&mdash;it is delineating
a general at the instant of victory; and so
far from bearing any marks of satire, that it might be
almost mistaken for a panegyric. To say the truth,
though his friend Churchill has thrown the picture
into shadow, and given only the dark tints, Mr.
Wilkes seemed willing enough to receive it as such;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
and I am informed, frequently told his friends that
he every day grew into a stronger resemblance. The
pleasant and philosophic indifference with which he
spoke of it at the time, did honour to his good humour
and his good sense. He declared himself very little
concerned about the case of his soul, as he was only
tenant for life, and that the best apology for his person
was, that he did not make himself.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Such was the style of Mr. Wilkes. As to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>Churchill, his temper must have forsaken him; and
every circumstance taken into the account, when describing
this transaction, he seems to have forgotten
that satire ought to be at least seasoned with truth.
Brilliant diction, animated verse, and high-sounding
words, are very apt to impose. Churchill's is a muse
of fire, and dazzles the eye like the sun in its meridian
splendour; it fascinates the mind, and carries the most
sober reason into the airy regions of imagination.
This considered, before I insert his bitter satire, it
will be but fair to give a candid and dispassionate
relation of that which provoked it.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wilkes was the second time brought
from the Tower to Westminster Hall, and had in one
day an honourable acquittal, an universal acclamation,
and a proud triumph, Mr. Hogarth attended in the
court of Common Pleas, and, as was his constant custom,
carried a port-crayon in his pocket. Surrounded
by a crowd of spectators, who came to see how the
cause would terminate, he took a portrait of Mr.
Wilkes: delineated a patriot at the moment when he
was in his own person asserting the cause of liberty, and
by his own trial ascertaining the law of his country.
But, replies an advocate for Mr. Wilkes, "Hogarth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
certainly intended to make a caricature."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> To this
I have no other answer than pointing to the print,
which, being compared with the original, will prove
to every dispassionate inquirer what it is my wish to
establish, <em>i.e.</em> that it has been mistaken for a caricature,
from the world knowing the provocation which
Hogarth had previously received, and which every
man felt would have justified the most severe retaliation.</p>

<p>What! Consider it as a satire to hand down to
posterity a patriot at the moment of inspiration!
"While every breast caught the holy flame of liberty,
and all his fellow-citizens were animated in his cause,
for they knew it to be their own cause, that of their
country, and of its laws. It was declared to be so
a few hours afterwards by the unanimous sentence
of the Judges of that Court; and they were all present."</p>

<p>From the style in which the bard relates this transaction,
a plain reader would be tempted to think
that Hogarth had stolen into Westminster Hall with
a quiver full of poisoned arrows hung to his girdle,
and, like a murderous ruffian, hid himself behind the
arras, that he might seize the first opportunity of
assassinating this paragon of patriotism.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capx">Enraged by the publication of Mr. Wilkes'
portrait, Mr. Charles Churchill drew his
gray goose quill, and wrote a most virulent
and vindictive satire, which he entitled <cite>An Epistle to
William Hogarth</cite>. The painter might be a very
good Christian, but he was not blest with that meek
forbearance which induces those who are smote on
one cheek to turn the other also. He was an old
man, but did not wish to be considered as that feeble,
superannuated, helpless animal which the poet had
described. He scarcely wished to live</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"After his flame lack'd oil, to be the snuff</p>
<p class="verse">Of younger spirits."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Apprehensive that the public might construe his
delaying a reply to proceed from inability, he did not
wait the tedious process of a new plate, but took a
piece of copper on which he had, in the year 1749,
engraven a portrait of himself and dog, erased his
own head, and in the place of it introduced the divine
with a tattered band and torn ruffles,&mdash;"No Lord's
anointed, but a Russian bear."</p>

<p>In this I must acknowledge there was more ill-nature
than wit.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> It is rather caricature than character,
and more like the coarse mangling of Tom
Browne than the delicate yet wounding satire of
Alexander Pope. For this rough retort he might,
however, plead the poet's precedent. His opponent
had brandished a tomahawk; and Hogarth, old as
he was, wielded a battle-axe in his own defence. A
more aggravated provocation cannot well be conceived.
The attack was unmerciful, unmanly, unjust.
Let the following extracts speak for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Amongst the sons of men, how few are known</p>
<p class="verse">Who dare be just to merit not their own!</p>
<p class="verse">Superior virtue and superior sense,</p>
<p class="verse">To knaves and fools will always give offence:</p>
<p class="verse">Nay, men of real worth can scarcely bear&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">So nice is jealousy&mdash;a rival there."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Such is the introduction to Churchill's Epistle, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
believe the reader will grant that it is quite as applicable
to the poet as the painter. After some lines
which would apply to any other subject as well as
that under consideration, he thus proceeds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Hogarth,&mdash;I take thee, Candour, at thy word,</p>
<p class="verse">Accept thy proffer'd terms, and will be heard;</p>
<p class="verse">Thee have I heard with virulence declaim,</p>
<p class="verse">Nothing retained of Candour but the name;</p>
<p class="verse">By thee have I been charg'd in angry strains,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
<p class="verse">With that mean falsehood which my soul disdains."</p>
</div></div>

<p>How furious the onset! but if the lines are brought
back to plain prose, they will run thus: "Hogarth,
thy word is candour. I adopt the same word, and
having heard <em>thee</em> declaim with a virulence that retained
nothing of candour but the name, thou shalt
hear me declaim in the same style."</p>

<p>That this is the precise meaning which the poet
intended, I will not presume to assert; but that he
has pursued his theme in a manner that amply
justifies my supposition, the following lines will
abundantly prove:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Hogarth, stand forth,&mdash;nay, hang not thus aloof,</p>
<p class="verse">Now Candour, now thou shalt receive such proof,</p>
<p class="verse">Such damning proof, that henceforth thou shalt fear</p>
<p class="verse">To tax my wrath, and own my conduct clear.</p>
<p class="verse">Hogarth, stand forth,&mdash;I dare thee to be try'd</p>
<p class="verse">In that great court where Conscience must preside:</p>
<p class="verse">At that most solemn bar hold up thy hand;</p>
<p class="verse">Think before whom, on what account you stand.</p>
<p class="verse">Speak, but consider well&mdash;from first to last</p>
<p class="verse">Review thy life, view every action past:</p>
<p class="verse">Nay, you shall have no reason to complain,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Take longer time, and view them o'er again:</p>
<p class="verse">Canst thou remember from thy earliest youth,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">And as thy God must judge thee, speak the truth,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">A single instance where, self laid aside,</p>
<p class="verse">And justice taking place of fear and pride,</p>
<p class="verse">Thou with an equal eye didst genius view,</p>
<p class="verse">And give to merit what was merit's due?</p>
<p class="verse">Genius and merit are a sure offence,</p>
<p class="verse">And thy soul sickens at the name of sense."</p>
</div></div>

<p>If Hogarth had so marked an aversion to all genius,
merit, and sense, it is rather singular that he should
have lived on such intimate terms with Mr. Churchill
and Mr. Wilkes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Is any one so foolish to succeed?</p>
<p class="verse">On Envy's altar he is doomed to bleed.</p>
<p class="verse">Hogarth, a guilty pleasure in his eyes,</p>
<p class="verse">The place of executioner supplies:</p>
<p class="verse">See how he gloats, enjoys the sacred feast,</p>
<p class="verse">And proves himself by cruelty a priest."</p>
</div></div>

<p>What does the bard prove himself?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Whilst the weak artist to thy whims a slave,</p>
<p class="verse">Would bury all those powers which nature gave,</p>
<p class="verse">Would suffer blank concealment to obscure</p>
<p class="verse">Those rays that jealousy could not endure;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<p class="verse">To feed thy vanity would rust unknown,</p>
<p class="verse">And to secure thy credit, blast his own:</p>
<p class="verse">In Hogarth he was sure to find a friend;</p>
<p class="verse">He could not fear, and therefore might commend.</p>
<p class="verse">But when his spirit, rous'd by honest shame,</p>
<p class="verse">Shook off that lethargy, and soar'd to fame;</p>
<p class="verse">When with the pride of man resolv'd and strong,</p>
<p class="verse">He scorn'd those fears which did his honour wrong;</p>
<p class="verse">And on himself determin'd to rely,</p>
<p class="verse">Brought forth his labours to the public eye,</p>
<p class="verse">No friend in thee could such a rebel know,</p>
<p class="verse">He had desert, and Hogarth was his foe."</p>
</div></div>

<p>He must be a very weak artist indeed who would
bury the talents which Nature gave, to gratify the
whims of another man; but admitting a painter had
been found "who suffered blank concealment to obscure
those rays which jealousy could not endure,"
I cannot comprehend how it concerned Hogarth.
His walk was all his own: even now he need not
dread a rival there. Mr. Churchill acknowledges that
in walks of humour</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Hogarth unrivall'd stands, and shall engage</p>
<p class="verse">Unrivall'd praise to the most distant age!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Being unrivalled, I do not see why he should dread
a rival; nor can I conceive he could be jealous of
talents which he must be conscious were inferior to
his own.</p>

<p>After some very harsh lines on envy, in no degree
applicable to Hogarth, and the rhapsody about
Wilkes and Liberty, which I have noticed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
preceding plate, this high priest of the Temple of
Cruelty, rejoicing in his strength and triumphing in
the pride of his youth, without any reverence for gray
hairs or respect for superior talents, sets up the war-whoop,
and springs upon a feeble old man with the
ferocity of a hungry cannibal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"With all the symptoms of assur'd decay,</p>
<p class="verse">With age and sickness pinch'd and worn away,</p>
<p class="verse">Pale quivering lips, lank cheeks, and faltering tongue,</p>
<p class="verse">The spirits out of tune, the nerves unstrung,</p>
<p class="verse">The body shrivell'd up, the dim eyes sunk</p>
<p class="verse">Within their sockets deep; the weak hams shrunk,</p>
<p class="verse">The body's weight unable to sustain,</p>
<p class="verse">The stream of life scarce trembling through the vein:</p>
<p class="verse">More than half kill'd by honest truths which fell,</p>
<p class="verse">Through thy own fault, from men who wish'd thee well;</p>
<p class="verse">Canst thou e'en thus thy thoughts to vengeance give,</p>
<p class="verse">And dead to all things else, to malice live?</p>
<p class="verse">Hence, dotard, to thy closet; shut thee in,</p>
<p class="verse">By deep repentance wash away thy sin;</p>
<p class="verse">From haunts of men, to shame and sorrow fly,</p>
<p class="verse">And on the verge of death learn how to die."</p>
</div></div>

<p>That a man in the vigour of life&mdash;for Churchill
was not much more than thirty years old&mdash;should
draw so pitiable a picture of age and decrepitude, and
then attack that age and decrepitude with a barbarity
so savage, is horrible! But the baleful spirit of party
overthrows the barriers of truth, eradicates philanthropy,
and severs those social, I had almost said
sacred, bonds which ought to unite and attach men
of genius to each other. Had Churchill felt his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
beautiful apostrophe, he would have blotted the lines
with his tears:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Ah! let not youth to insolence allied,</p>
<p class="verse">In heat of blood, in full career of pride,</p>
<p class="verse">Possessed of genius, with unhallowed rage,</p>
<p class="verse">Mock the infirmities of reverend age.</p>
<p class="verse">The greatest genius to this fate may bow."</p>
<p class="verse12">&mdash;<cite>Churchill's Epistle to Hogarth.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>After advising the painter to learn how to die, the
bard proceeds; repeats and amplifies what he had
before written on Hogarth's envy, gives a metrical
version of that <cite>North Briton</cite> which ridicules the
artist's love of flattery, and beautifully versifies Mr.
Wilkes' prosaic abuse of poor "Sigismunda."</p>

<p>In the lines which follow, he first throws the gauntlet,
and then draws such a picture of the man he has
challenged as must have subdued the rancour of an
assassin; so far from being a stimulus to revenge, it
excites pity, and concludes in the form of an apology:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"For me, who, warm and zealous for my friend,</p>
<p class="verse">In spite of railing thousands, will commend;</p>
<p class="verse">And no less warm and zealous 'gainst my foes,</p>
<p class="verse">Spite of commending thousands will oppose;</p>
<p class="verse">I dare thy worst, with scorn behold thy rage,</p>
<p class="verse">But with an eye of pity view thy age;</p>
<p class="verse">Thy feeble age, in which as in a glass</p>
<p class="verse">We see how men to dissolution pass.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou wretched being, whom on reason's plan,</p>
<p class="verse">So chang'd, so lost, I cannot call a man,</p>
<p class="verse">What could persuade thee at this time of life</p>
<p class="verse">To launch afresh into this sea of strife?</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<p class="verse">Better for thee, scarce crawling on the earth,</p>
<p class="verse">Almost as much a child as at thy birth,</p>
<p class="verse">To have resign'd in peace thy parting breath,</p>
<p class="verse">And sunk unnotic'd in the arms of death.</p>
<p class="verse">Why would thy gray, gray hairs resentment brave,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus to go down with sorrow to the grave?</p>
<p class="verse">Now by my soul it makes me blush to know</p>
<p class="verse">My spirits could descend to such a foe.</p>
<p class="verse">Whatever cause thy vengeance might provoke,</p>
<p class="verse">It seems rank cowardice to give the stroke."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Seems, Churchill!&mdash;nay, it is!</p>

<p>The following address to the artist may, with
infinitely more propriety, be applied to the bard;
whose name I have therefore ventured to insert in the
place where he has left the name of Hogarth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"With so much merit, and so much success,</p>
<p class="verse">With so much power to curse, so much to bless,</p>
<p class="verse">Would he have been man's friend instead of foe,</p>
<p class="verse">Churchill had been a little god below.</p>
<p class="verse">Why, then, like savage giants fam'd of old,</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom in Scripture story we are told,</p>
<p class="verse">Dost thou in cruelty that strength employ,</p>
<p class="verse">Which Nature meant to save, not to destroy?</p>
<p class="verse">Why dost thou, all in horrid pomp array'd,</p>
<p class="verse">Sit grinning o'er the ruins thou hast made?</p>
<p class="verse">Most rank ill-nature must applaud thy art,</p>
<p class="verse">But even Candour must condemn thy heart."</p>
<p class="verse16">&mdash;<cite>Epistle to Hogarth.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>The whole of this unfeeling composition is dictated
by the same spirit, and written in much the same
style, as the lines I have quoted; it reflects more
dishonour on the satirist than on the subject of his
abuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>To enumerate further examples would be painful
as well as tedious: the <em>graven image</em> must be attended
to.</p>

<p>It represents Mr. Churchill in the character of a
bear hugging a foaming tankard of porter,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and like
another Hercules, armed with a knotted club, to
attack hydras, destroy dragons, and discomfit giants!</p>

<p>From the two letters "N. B." inscribed on the club,
it appears that the painter considered Churchill as a
writer in the <cite>North Briton</cite>; and from the words "infamous
fallacy, Lie the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th," etc., on each
of the knots, that he also considered him as a poet
who did not pay the strictest regard to truth.</p>

<p>To designate more positively the object of his ridicule,
and render this rude representative still more
ludicrous, it is decorated with a band and a pair of
ruffles; and with these characteristic ornaments,
though it remains a good bear, it becomes a sort of
overcharged portrait of the reverend satirist, and I
really think resembles him.</p>

<p>Hogarth's favourite dog Trump, who had been his
companion in the portrait from which this is altered,
retains his original situation on the outside of the picture
frame, but is now contemptuously treating and
trampling upon the Epistle to his master. Near him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
lie two books, on one of which is written, "<cite>A New
Way to Pay Old Debts</cite>, a comedy, by Massinger:"
on the other, "<em>A List of Subscribers to the North
Briton</em>." To intimate the poverty of those who
wrote it, the pyramid is crowned by a begging-box;
and beneath, as emblems of art, lie a pencil and
palette.</p>

<p>In this state the print was published; but the
gentleman whom it offended asserting that it proved
the painter in his dotage, he refuted their calumny
by the following spirited addition:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the form of a framed picture on the painter's
palette, is placed a small drawing, which may serve
as a sort of political postscript to his first plate of
"The Times," or a kind of prelude to the second. It
represents Mr. Pitt reclining in a similar position to
that of Sir Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey, and
is probably meant as allusive to his having retired
from public business, to enjoy the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">otium cum dignitate</i>,
a short time before. The background is composed of
a pyramidical piece of marble, from the top of which
is suspended a millstone, inscribed "£3000," in allusion
to his saying that "Hanover was a millstone
round the neck of England," and afterwards increasing
the public burdens by accepting a pension of
£3000 a year. It is suspended by a thread, and
must, if it falls, dash him to pieces. This was
Hogarth's idea of crushing popularity. To heighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the ridicule, though recumbent, he is firing a mortar
at the symbol of peace, "a dove with an olive branch"
perched on the standard of England; but his artillery
is not powerful enough to reach the mark; the powder
fails in its effect, the ball falls short of its object. In
most of his measures Mr. Pitt was supported by the
city of London, and to this our great metropolis
Hogarth appears to allude, in making the two Guildhall
giants, with each of them a pipe of tobacco in
his mouth, supporters of the Monument. The tubes
with Indian weed evidently hint at his great Creolian
friend, Mr. Alderman Beckford. To denote that Mr.
Pitt was the sovereign of their affections, and kept
the master-key of their iron chests, one of these representatives
of the city is giving him supreme rule, by
placing upon his head "the likeness of a kingly
crown." The other holds a shield, on which is emblazoned
the arms of Austria, which the statesman
indignantly spurns. At an opposite corner, the
painter has exhibited himself, in the humble character
of a showman, drilling Messrs. Churchill and
Wilkes through the varying steps of a political
minuet. The first he has represented under the type
of a bear in a laced hat, and the last as a monkey
astride upon a mop-stick, with the cap of liberty at
the top of it. In his left hand he holds a check-string,
which being fastened to his two pupils, answers
the purpose of a bridle, and in his right brandishes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cat-o'-nine-tails. That the two quadrupeds may
dance to some tune, a figure without features, intended
as a second delineation of Earl Temple, is
playing on the fiddle.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Such is Hogarth's representation; and in the poem
of <cite>Independence</cite>, which Churchill <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'published in Septemper'">published in September</ins>
1764, he admirably parries the caricature by
a most spirited description of himself. In this he
has evidently taken Hogarth's print for his model.
Having described a lean, long, lank, and bony figure,
designed for a then unpopular nobleman, he thus
proceeds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Such was the first. The second was a man</p>

<p>In the following letter written to his friend Mr.
Wilkes, and dated August 3, 1763, Churchill considers
Hogarth as already dead:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill died at Boulogne in his thirty-second

</div>

<p class="noindent">This plate was engraved in 1733, and intended as
the subscription-ticket to "The Harlot's Progress;"
but in the original design Nature was habited in
a petticoat, and the boy who now points to a three-quarters
portrait was placed before her, and represented
as curiously stooping down to examine the
fringe. Some of the artist's friends, suggesting that
this was too ludicrous an idea for the public, the
copper was thrown aside.</p>

<p>In the year 1751, Hogarth etched his burlesque
"Paul," as a receipt-ticket to the large "Paul before
Felix." In a printed catalogue of his works, dated
1754, I find "Paul before Felix" marked £0, 7s. 6d.,
and "Paul before Felix, in the manner of Rembrandt,"
£0, 0s. 0d. Applications for the gratis etching were
very frequent; and he found, to his great mortification,
that the public were more eager to possess his
little print than either of the large ones. To punish
their want of taste, he gave away no more, but fixed
the price at two-thirds of the sum at which he published
the large print.</p>

<p>This alteration of his first plan left the great
"Paul" without a ticket. To have given him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>"Peeping Boys" in their original state, would have
been a species of sacrilege; they were chastened,
grouped as they now are, and transferred from the
"Harlot" to the "Apostle."</p>

<p>Though the circumstance from which it received a
name was done away, and very little either novel or
striking remains, he retained the original title of
"Boys Peeping at Nature."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">From the first print that Hogarth engraved to the
last that he published, I do not think there is one in
which character is more displayed than in this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
spirited little etching. It is much superior to the
more delicate engravings from his designs by other
artists, and I prefer it to those that were still higher
finished by his own burin.</p>

<p>The prim coxcomb with an enormous bag, whose
favours, like those of Hercules between Virtue and
Vice, are contended for by two rival orange girls,
gives an admirable idea of the dress of the day;
when, if we may judge from this print, our grave
forefathers, defying nature and despising convenience,
had a much higher rank in the temple of Folly than
was then attained by their ladies. It must be acknowledged
that since that period the softer sex
have asserted their natural rights; and, snatching
the wreath of fashion from the brow of presuming
man, have tortured it into such forms&mdash;that were it
possible, which certes it is not, to disguise a beauteous
face!&mdash;But to the high behest of fashion all must
bow.</p>

<p>Governed by this idol, our beau has a cuff that for a
modern fop would furnish fronts for a waistcoat, and
a family fire-screen might be made of his enormous
bag. His bare and shrivelled neck has a close resemblance
to that of a half-starved greyhound; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>his face, figure, and air, form a fine contrast to the
easy and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">degagée</i> assurance of the grisette whom he
addresses.</p>

<p>The opposite figure, nearly as grotesque, though
not quite so formal as <em>its</em> companion, presses <em>its</em> left
hand upon <em>its</em> breast,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> in the style of protestation,
and eagerly contemplating the superabundant charms
of a beauty of Rubens' school, presents her with a
pinch of comfort.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Every muscle, every line of his
countenance, is acted upon by affectation and grimace,
and his queue bears some resemblance to an ear-trumpet.</p>

<p>The total inattention of these three polite persons
to the business of the stage, which at this moment
almost convulses the children of Nature who are
seated in the pit, is highly descriptive of that refined
apathy which characterizes our people of fashion, and
raises them above those mean passions that agitate
the groundlings.</p>

<p>One gentleman, indeed,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> is as affectedly unaffected
as a man of the first world. By his saturnine cast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>face and contracted brow, he is evidently a profound
critic, and much too wise to laugh. He must indisputably
be a very great genius; for, like Voltaire's
Poccocurante, nothing can please him; and while
those around open every avenue of their minds to
mirth, and are willing to be delighted, though they
do not well know why, he analyzes the drama by the
laws of Aristotle, and finding those laws are violated,
determines that the author ought to be hissed instead
of being applauded. This it is to be so excellent a
judge; this it is which gives a critic that exalted
gratification which can never be attained by the
illiterate: the supreme power of pointing out faults
where others discern nothing but beauties, and preserving
a rigid inflexibility of muscle while the sides
of the vulgar herd are shaking with laughter. These
merry mortals, thinking with Plato that it is no proof
of a good stomach to nauseate every aliment presented
them, do not inquire too nicely into <em>causes</em>;
but, giving full scope to their risibility, display a set
of features more highly ludicrous than I ever saw in
any other print. It is to be regretted that the artist
has not given us some clue by which we might have
known what was the play which so much delighted
his audience: I should conjecture that it was either
one of Shakspeare's comedies, or a modern tragedy.
Sentimental comedy was not the fashion of that day.</p>

<p>The three sedate musicians in the orchestra, totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
engrossed by minims and crotchets, are an admirable
contrast to the company in the pit.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LECTURE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I was once told by a fellow of a college that he would
never purchase Hogarth's works, because Hogarth
had in this print ridiculed one of the Universities.
I endeavoured to defend the artist, by suggesting
that this was not intended as a picture of what Oxford
is now, but of what it was in days long past: that it
was that kind of general satire with which no one
should be offended, etc. etc. His reply was too
memorable to be forgotten: "Sir, the Theatre, the
Bench, the College of Physicians, and the Foot
Guards, are fair objects of satire; but those venerable
characters who have devoted their whole lives to feeding
the lamp of learning with hallowed oil, are too
sacred to be the sport of an uneducated painter. Their
unremitting industry embraced the whole circle of the
sciences, and in their logical disputations they displayed
an acuteness that their followers must contemplate
with astonishment. The present state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Oxford it is not necessary for me to analyze, as you
contend that the satire is not directed against that."</p>

<p>In answer to this observation, which was uttered
with becoming gravity, a gentleman present remarked
as follows: "For some of the ancient customs of this
seminary of learning I have much respect; but as to
their dry treatises on logic, immaterial dissertations
on materiality, and abstruse investigations of useless
subjects, they are mere literary legerdemain. Their
disputations being usually built on an undefinable
chimera, are solved by a paradox. Instead of exercising
their power of reason, they exert their powers
of sophistry, and divide and subdivide every subject
with such casuistical minuteness, that those who are
not convinced are almost invariably confounded.
This custom, it must be granted, is not quite so prevalent
as it once was: a general spirit of reform is
rapidly diffusing itself; and though I have heard
cold-blooded declaimers assert that these shades of
science are become the retreats of ignorance and
the haunts of dissipation, I consider them as the
great schools of urbanity, and favourite seats of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</i>. By the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</i> I mean history,
biography, and poetry; that all these are universally
cultivated, I can exemplify by the manner in which
a highly accomplished young man, who is considered
as a model by his fellow-collegians, divides his hours.</p>

<p>"At breakfast I found him studying the marvellous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>and eventful history of <cite>Baron Munchausen</cite>; a work
whose periods are equally free from the long-winded
obscurity of Tacitus, and the asthmatic terseness
of Sallust. While his hair was dressing, he enlarged
his imagination and improved his morals by studying
Doctor what's his name's <cite>Abridgment of Chesterfield's
Principles of Politeness</cite>. To furnish himself
with biographical information, and add to his stock
of useful anecdote, he studied the <cite>Lives of the Highwaymen</cite>;
in which he found many opportunities of
exercising his genius and judgment in drawing parallels
between the virtues and exploits of these modern
worthies, and those dignified and almost deified
ancient heroes whose deeds are recorded in Plutarch
and Nepos.</p>

<p>"With poetical studies he is furnished by the English
operas, which, added to the prologues, epilogues,
and odes of the day, afford him higher entertainment
than he could find in Homer or Virgil: he has not
stored his memory with many epigrams, but of puns
has a plentiful stock, and in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conundra</i> is a wholesale
dealer. At the same college I know a most striking
contrast, whose reading"&mdash;&mdash; But as his opponent
would hear no more, my advocate dropped the subject;
and I will follow his example.</p>

<p>It seems probable that when the artist engraved
this print he had only a general reference to an university
lecture; the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">datur vacuum</i> were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
after-thought. I have seen prints without the inscription,
and in some of the early impressions it is
written with a pen.</p>

<p>The scene is laid at Oxford, and the person reading,
universally admitted to be a Mr. Fisher of Jesus
College, <em>registrat</em> of the university, with whose consent
this portrait was taken, and who lived until the 18th
of March 1761. That he should wish to have such
a face handed down to posterity in such company
is rather extraordinary; for all the band, except one
man, have been steeped in the stream of stupidity.
This gentleman has the profile of penetration; a
projecting forehead, a Roman nose, thin lips, and a
long pointed chin. His eye is bent on vacancy: it
is evidently directed to the moon-faced idiot that
crowns the pyramid, at whose round head, contrasted
by a cornered cap, he with difficulty supresses a laugh.
Three fellows on the right hand of this fat, contented
"first-born transmitter of a foolish face," have most
degraded characters, and are much fitter for the
stable than the college. If they ever read, it must
be in Bracken's <cite>Farriery</cite>, or <cite>The Country Gentleman's
Recreation</cite>. Two square-capped students a little
beneath the top, one of whom is holding converse
with an adjoining profile, and the other lifting up
his eyebrows and staring without sight, have the
same misfortune that attended our first James&mdash;their
tongues are rather too large. A figure in the left-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
corner has shut his eyes to think; and having,
in his attempt to separate a syllogism, placed the
forefinger of his right hand upon his forehead, has
fallen asleep. The professor, a little above the book,
endeavours by a projection of his under lip to assume
importance; such characters are not uncommon: they
are more solicitous to look wise than to be so. Of
Mr. Fisher it is not necessary to say much: he sat
for his portrait for the express purpose of having it
inserted in the "Lecture!"&mdash;We want no other testimony
of his talents. To the whole tribe I bid a long
and last adieu.</p>

appealed to the public, and printed<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> his oratorio.
Though it was adorned with a frontispiece designed
by Hogarth and engraved by Vandergucht, the
world could not be compelled to read, and the unhappy
writer had no other resource than the consolatory
reflection, that his work was superlatively
excellent, but unluckily printed in a tasteless age:<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> a
comfortable and solacing self-consciousness, which
hath, I verily believe, prevented many a great genius
from becoming his own executioner.</p>

<p>To paint a sound is impossible; but as far as art
can go towards it, Mr. Hogarth has gone in this print.
The tenor, treble, and bass of these ear-piercing
choristers are so decisively discriminated, that we all
but hear them.</p>

<p>The principal figure, whose head, hands, and feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>are in equal agitation, has very properly tied on his
spectacles; it would have been prudent to have tied
on his periwig also, for by the energy of his action
he has shaken it from his head, and, absorbed in an
eager attention to true time, is totally unconscious of
his loss.</p>

<p>A <em>gentleman</em>&mdash;pardon me, I meant <em>a singer</em>&mdash;in a
bag-wig, immediately beneath his uplifted hand, I
suspect to be of foreign growth. <em>It</em> has the engaging
air of <em>an importation from Italy</em>.</p>

<p>The little figure in the sinister corner is, it seems,
intended for a Mr. Tothall, a woollen-draper, who lived
in Tavistock Court, and was Hogarth's intimate
friend.</p>

<p class="noindent">I cannot learn; nor do I think that this group were
meant for particular portraits, but a general representation
of the violent distortions into which these
crotchet-mongers draw their features on such solemn
occasions.</p>

<p>Even the head of the bass viol has air and character:
by the band under the chin, it gives some idea
of a professor,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> or what is I think called a Mus. D.</p>

<p>The words now singing, "The world shall bow

style, and was originally given as a subscription-ticket

the three who are for distinction placed in the chief
or most honourable part of the escutcheon. Those

conclude the most distinguished and sagacious leeches

<p>The centre figure, arrayed in a harlequin jacket,
with a bone, or what the painter denominates a baton,
in the right hand, is generally considered designed
for Mrs. Mapp, a masculine woman, daughter to one
Wallin, a bone-setter at Hindon, in Wiltshire. This
female Thalestris, incompatible as it may seem with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>her sex, adopted her father's profession, travelled about
the country, calling herself <em>crazy Sally</em>; and like another
Hercules, did wonders by strength of arm! An
old gentleman, who knew this lady, assures me, that
notwithstanding all the unkind things which her medical
brethren said of her ignorance, etc., she was entitled
to an equal portion of professional praise with many
of those who decried her; for not more than nineteen
out of twenty of her patients died under her hands.</p>

the physician: his gravity, his cane head, and
his periwig. With these leading requisites, this venerable
party are most amply gifted. To specify every
character is not necessary; but the upper figure on the
dexter side, with a wig like a weeping willow, should
not be overlooked. His lemon-like aspect must curdle
the blood of all his patients. In the countenances of
his brethren there is no want of acids; but however

in Raphael; simplicity, greatness of conception, tranquillity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
superiority, sublimity the most exalted!
Raphael can never be enough studied, although he
only exercised his mind on the rarest forms, the
grandest traits of countenance.</p>

<p>"In Hogarth, alas, how little of the noble, how
little of beauteous expression, is to be found in this,
I had almost said, false prophet of beauty! But what
an immense treasure of features, of meanness in excess,
vulgarity the most disgusting, humour the most
irresistible, and vice the most unmanly!"&mdash;Lavater's
<cite>Essays on Physiognomy</cite>.</p>

<p>In this rhapsody there is some truth; but the
philosopher of Zurich should have recollected that
Hogarth could not be expected to attain what he never
attempted. Sublimity exalted, simplicity angelic,
and the ideal grandeur of superior beings, he left to
those who delineated subjects which demanded such
characters; and contented himself with representing
Nature, not as it ought to be, but as he found it.
That he had little reverence for the dreams of those
who portrayed imaginary beings, I have had occasion
to remark; but that he respected their waking thoughts
is evinced in this print, where the heads of three
figures from Raphael's Cartoons are introduced under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>the article character, in opposition to the fantastic caricatures
of Cavalier Chezze, Annibal Characi,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and
Leonard da Vinci: the last of whom, I am very sorry
to see so classed; for to his anatomical knowledge
the late Dr. Hunter gave the strongest testimony, by
declaring his intention to publish a volume illustrated
by the designs of this artist, as anatomical studies.</p>

<p>I have often seen three engravings from the same
picture, by an Italian, an English, and a French artist,
which, with a tolerable correctness of outline, have
in their general characters a dissimilarity that is
astonishing. Each engraver gives his national air.
The three heads from Raphael, at the bottom of this
print, are etched by Hogarth, and sufficiently marked
to determine the master from whence they are copied;
but their grandeur, elevation, and simplicity is totally
evaporated.</p>

<p>With angels, apostles, and saints, he was not
happy. In the group placed above them he has been
more successful. Hogarth was less of a mannerist
than almost any other artist; for though there are
above a hundred profiles, I discover no copy from
another painter; no repetition of his own works:
they are all delineated from nature, and the most
careless observer must discover many resemblances:
to the physiognomist, they are an inexhaustible
study.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The portrait of this sanguinary wretch Mr. Hogarth
painted in Newgate; and to Sir James Thornhill, who
accompanied him, he made the following observation:
"I see by this woman's features that she is capable of
any wickedness."</p>

<p>Of his skill in physiognomy I entertain a very high
opinion; but as Sarah sat for her picture after condemnation,
I suspect his observation to resemble
those prophecies which were made after the completion
of events they professed to foretell. She has a
locked-up mouth, wide nostrils, and a penetrating eye,
with a general air that indicates close observation
and masculine courage; but I do not discover either
depravity or cruelty; though her conduct in this, as
well as some other horrible transactions,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> evinced an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>uncommon portion of both, and proved her a Lady
Macbeth in low life.</p>

<p>Her infatuation in lurking about the Temple after
perpetration of the crime for which she suffered, it is
difficult to account for upon any other principle than
that general remorse and horror which tortures the
minds of those who shed a brother's blood; and that
overruling Providence, which by means most strange
brings their guilt to light and their crimes to punishment;</p>

<p class="verse">With most miraculous organ."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The circumstances which attended her commitment
and execution were briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>At noon, on Sunday the fourth of February 1733,
Mrs. Duncombe, a widow lady, upwards of eighty
years old (who lived up four pair of stairs, next staircase
to the Inner Temple library); Elizabeth Harrison,
another elderly person who was her companion;
and Anne Price, her servant, about seventeen years of
age, were found murdered in their beds. The maid-servant,
who was supposed to be murdered first, had
her throat cut from ear to ear; but by her cap being
off, and her hair much entangled, it was thought she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
had struggled. The companion, it was supposed, was
strangled; though there were two or three wounds in
her throat that appeared as if they had been given
by a nail. Mrs. Duncombe was probably smothered,
and killed last, as she was found lying across the
bed with a gown on; though the others were in bed.
A trunk in the room was broke open and rifled.</p>

<p>About one o'clock at night, a Mr. Kerrell, who had
chambers on the same staircase, came home, and to
his great surprise found Sarah Malcolm, who was his
laundress, in his room: he asked her how she came
to be there at so unseasonable an hour, and if she
had heard of any one being taken up for the murder?
She replied, "that no person had yet been taken up;
but a gentleman who had chambers beneath, and
had been absent two or three days, was violently suspected."
"Be that as it may," said Mr. Kerrell, "you
were Mrs. Duncombe's laundress, and no one who
knew her shall ever come into these chambers until
her murderer is discovered: pack up your things and
go away." While she was thus employed, Kerrell
observing a bundle upon the floor, and thinking her
behaviour suspicious, called a watchman to whom he
gave her in charge. When she was taken away,
and he searched his rooms with more care, he found
several bundles of linen, and a silver pint tankard,
with the handle bloodied. This confirmed his suspicions,
and, accompanied by a friend, he went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
stairs, and asked the watchman where he had taken
Malcolm? This faithful guardian of the night very
coolly replied, "that she had promised to come again
next day, and he had let her go." Mr. Kerrell declaring
that if she was not immediately produced he
would commit him to Newgate in her stead, the
fellow went in search of her; and though her lodging
was in Shoreditch, he found this infatuated woman
sitting between two other watchman at the Temple
gate. She was then committed to Newgate; and
there was found concealed in her hair, eighteen
guineas, twenty moidores, five broad pieces, five
crown pieces, and a few shillings.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>On her examination before Sir Richard Brocas,
she confessed to sharing in the produce of the robbery,
but declared herself innocent of the murders;
asserting upon oath, that Thomas and James Alexander,
and Mary Tracy, were principal parties in
the whole transaction. Notwithstanding this, the
coroner's jury brought in their verdict of wilful
murder against Sarah Malcolm only, it not then
appearing that any other person was concerned.
Her confession they considered as a mere subterfuge,
none knowing such people as she pretended
were her accomplices.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>A few days after, a boy about seventeen years of
age was hired as a servant by a person who kept the
Red Lion alehouse at Bridewell Bridge; and hearing
it said in his master's house that Sarah Malcolm
had given in an information against one Thomas
and James Alexander, and Mary Tracy, said to his
master, "My name is James Alexander, and I have
a brother named Thomas, and my mother nursed a
woman where Sarah Malcolm lived." Upon this
acknowledgment, the master sent to Alstone, turnkey
of Newgate; and the boy being confronted with
Malcolm, she immediately charged him with being
concealed under Mrs. Duncombe's bed, previous to
letting in Tracy and his brother, by whom and himself
the murders were committed. On this evidence
he was detained; and frankly telling where his
brother and Tracy were to be found, they also were
taken into custody, and brought before Sir Richard
Brocas. Here Malcolm persisted in her former asseverations;
but the magistrate thought her unworthy
of credit, and would have discharged them; but
being advised by some persons present to act with
more caution, committed them all to Newgate. Their
distress was somewhat alleviated by the gentlemen
of the Temple Society, who, fully convinced of
their innocence, allowed each of them one shilling
per diem during the time of their confinement.
This ought to be recorded to the honour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
<em>law</em>, as it has not often been the <em>practice</em> of the
profession.</p>

<p>Though Malcolm's presence of mind seems to have
forsaken her at the time when she lurked about the
Temple, without making any attempt to escape, and
left the produce of her theft in situations that rendered
discovery inevitable, she by the time of trial
recovered her recollection, made a most acute and
ingenious defence,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and cross-examined the witnesses
with all the black-robed artifice of a gentleman bred
up to the bar. The circumstances were, however,
so clear as to leave no doubt in the minds of the
court, and the jury brought in their verdict&mdash;guilty.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the 7th of March, about ten in the
morning, she was taken in a cart from Newgate to
the place of execution, facing Mitre Court, Fleet
Street,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and there suffered death on a gibbet erected
for the occasion. She was neatly dressed in a crape
mourning gown, white apron, sarcenet hood, and
black gloves: carried her head aside with an air of
affectation, and was said to be painted. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>attended by Doctor Middleton of St. Bride's, her
friend Mr. Peddington, and Guthrie, the ordinary of
Newgate. She appeared devout and penitent, and
earnestly requested Peddington would print a paper
she had given him<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> the night before, which contained,
not a confession of the murder, but protestations of
her innocence; and a recapitulation of what she had
before said relative to the Alexanders, etc. This
wretched woman, though only twenty-five years of
age, was so lost to all sense of her situation, as to
rush into eternity with a lie upon her lips. She much
wished to see Mr. Kerrell, and acquitted him of every
imputation thrown out at her trial.</p>

<p>After she had conversed some time with the ministers,
and the executioner began to do his duty, she
fainted away; but recovering, was in a short space
afterwards executed. Her corpse was carried to an
undertaker's on Snow Hill, where multitudes of
people resorted, and gave money to see it: among
the rest, a gentleman in deep mourning kissed her,
and gave the attendants half-a-crown.</p>

<p>Professor Martin dissected this notorious murderess,
and afterwards presented her skeleton, in a glass case,
to the Botanic Gardens at Cambridge, where it still
remains.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>The portrait from which this print was engraved
is remarkably well painted, and now in the possession
of Mr. Josiah Boydell, at West End. It was probably
copied from that which was painted in Newgate,
which was in the collection of Mr. Horace Walpole,
at Strawberry Hill. It will not appear extraordinary
that Hogarth should have delineated her twice, when
we consider, that from the print he published there
were four copies, besides one in wood, which was
engraved for the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>Thus eager were the public to possess the portrait
of this most atrocious woman. All these delineations
were what the painters call half-lengths; her whole
figure was never engraved, except for this work.</p>

<p class="noindent">Such is the animated apostrophe of Sarpedon in the
energetic numbers of Alexander Pope, and it is not
more appropriate to Glaucus than to the illustrious
character who gives the subject of this print. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a Greek discovered America, Sculpture would have
erected statues and raised altars to his honour;
Architecture built temples to perpetuate his fame;
and by Poetry he must have been deified.</p>

<p>The new creation of Columbus&mdash;for a new creation
it may be denominated&mdash;absorbed every former discovery,
and sunk to insignificance the boasted conquests
of Alexander. Previous to this voyage a world
of water formed what was deemed an insurmountable
barrier between the inhabitants of one planet;&mdash;"He
spread his canvas wings, and pass'd the mound."</p>

<p>As our own Newton unveiled the celestial globe,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
and removed that cloud which had before shadowed
the face of heaven, Columbus, from the bare inspection
of a map of one world, concluded that there must be
another. He sailed west, brought together continents
that nature had severed, and was the first adventurer
in a voyage which, from its consequent enterprises,
has added more square miles to the dominions of
European powers than the sovereigns by whom he
was employed possessed acres.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> His perseverance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>must have been equal to his genius; for he had to
struggle with the rooted prejudices of his contemporaries,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
as well as the freezing indifference of those
monarchs to whom he tendered his service.</p>

<p>Genoa, which was his native country, treated his
scheme as visionary. Our seventh Henry, mean, cold-blooded,
and avaricious, would not hazard the loss of
that treasure which he adored; and the Emperor
had neither gold to fit out a fleet nor harbours to
receive shipping. The attention of John the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of Portugal was engrossed by the coast of Africa, and
Charles the Eighth of France was in his minority.
The Venetians had maritime power, and maritime
spirit; but Columbus was a Genoese, and had too
much of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor patriæ</i> to throw such advantages as
he foresaw would accrue to those who prosecuted his
plan into the hands of the rivals and enemies of his
country. He fixed his hopes on the court of Spain,
and his hopes were not disappointed. Ferdinand of
Aragon and Isabella of Castile had by their marriage
united all Spain under one dominion: to them he
applied; and, with a perseverance that could only be
supported by a conscious certainty that his project,
if undertaken, must be successful, attended their court
eight tedious years! At the end of this time, two
merchants, trusting to royal security, and advancing
seventeen thousand ducats towards fitting out the
vessels, Columbus received his patent; and on the
23d of August 1492 set sail, with three ships only,
from the port of Palos in Andalusia.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>In less than a month after his departure from the
Canaries, he discovered the first island in America;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>and like our immortal Admiral Drake, found the fair
harvest he had hoped to reap in great danger of
being blighted by the murmuring and discontent of
his crew. To check this mutinous spirit required both
resolution and address, and in Columbus they were
united. He quieted his companions, and, with true
catholic formality, baptized his new discovery St. Salvadore.
He soon after made the Lucayan Islands,
together with those of Cuba and Hispaniola, now
called St. Domingo; and, at the end of nine months,
returned with some of the natives, a quantity of gold,
and sundry curious productions of the places he had
visited,&mdash;all of which he laid at the feet of Isabella
and Ferdinand.</p>

<p>Their Majesties were neither insensible of his merit
nor ungrateful for his services: they suffered him to
be seated, and added a privilege heretofore confined
to grandees&mdash;the honour of being covered in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
presence; and crowned their favours by creating him
admiral and viceroy of whatever he should add to
their dominions.</p>

<p>Columbus having found a new empire, and explored
a new world, was now considered as more
than mortal. Those who had loudly decried his
plan as the chimerical project of a madman, were
most eager to patronize the heaven-born navigator,
and embark under his command. He a second time
set sail, not with three small vessels, but an armament
of seventeen ships, manned by a crew who
almost adored him, and discovered Jamaica, the
Caribbees, and several other islands.</p>

<p>His elevation had been too sudden <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'to be permament'">to be permanent</ins>;
his talents were too transcendent to be
seen without envy. Notwithstanding the services
which he had rendered to Spain, the dignities with
which he was invested, and the flattering prospects
with which he set sail, he was brought home prisoner,
by judges who had been sent on board the same
vessel as spies upon his conduct; and arrived at the
court where he had a short time before been covered
with laurels&mdash;loaded with chains.</p>

<p>For this mortifying degradation he was indebted
to Fonseca, Bishop of Burgos, the intendant of the
expedition. Isabella, ashamed of seeing a man to
whom she was indebted for the brightest jewel in her
crown thus dishonoured, ordered him to be imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>diately
set at liberty; but it does not appear that
either queen or king punished the person by whose
machinations he had been so ignominiously treated.
Whether his royal protectors feared that he would
retain whatever he might acquire, wished personally
to scrutinize his actions, or had any other inducement,
he was not suffered to leave Spain for upwards of four
years. At the expiration of that time he was sent
upon another voyage, discovered the continent at
six degrees distant from the equator; and saw that
part of the coast on which Carthagena has been since
built.</p>

<p>After several years' absence he returned to Spain,
and in the year 1506 died at Valladolid. By the
king's command, he was honoured with a magnificent
funeral; and on the marble which covered his
remains was the following concise and characteristic
epitaph: <span class="smcap">Columbus gave Castile and Leon a
New World</span>.</p>

<p>By the success of his first voyage, doubt had been
changed into admiration; from the honours with
which he was rewarded, admiration degenerated into
envy. To deny that his discovery carried in its train
consequences infinitely more important than had
resulted from any made since the creation, was impossible.
His enemies had recourse to another
expedient, and boldly asserted that there was neither
wisdom in the plan nor hazard in the enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was once at a Spanish supper, the company
took this ground; and being by his narrative
furnished with the reflections which had induced him
to undertake his voyage, and the course that he had
pursued in its completion, sagaciously observed, that
"it was impossible for any man a degree above an
idiot to have failed of success. The whole process
was so obvious, it must have been seen by a man who
was half blind! Nothing could be so easy!"</p>

<p>"It is not difficult, now I have pointed out the
way," was the answer of Columbus; "but easy as it
will appear, when you are possessed of my method, I
do not believe that, without such instruction, any
person present could place one of these eggs upright
on the table." The cloth, knives, and forks were
thrown aside, and two of the party, placing their eggs
as required, kept them steady with their fingers. One
of them swore there could be no other way. "We will
try," said the navigator; and giving an egg, which he
held in his hand, a smart stroke upon the table, it
remained upright.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The emotions which this excited
in the company are expressed in their countenances.
In the be-ruffed booby at his left hand, it raises
astonishment; he is a <span class="fs80">DEAR ME!</span> man, of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
family with Sterne's Simple Traveller, and came
from <em>Amiens only yesterday</em>. The fellow behind him,
beating his head, curses his own stupidity; and the
whiskered ruffian, with his forefinger on the egg, is in
his heart cursing Columbus. As to the two veterans
on the other side, they have lived too long to be
agitated with trifles: he who wears a cap exclaims,
"Is this all!" and the other, with a bald head, "By
St. Jago, I did not think of that!" In the face of
Columbus there is not that violent and excessive
triumph which is exhibited by little characters on
little occasions: he is too elevated to be overbearing;
and, pointing to the conical solution of his problematical
conundrum, displays a calm superiority, and
silent internal contempt.</p>

<p>Two eels, twisted round the eggs upon the dish, are
introduced as specimens of the line of beauty; which
is again displayed on the table-cloth, and hinted at
on the knife blade. In all these curves there is
peculiar propriety; for the etching was given as a
receipt-ticket to the <cite>Analysis</cite>, where this favourite
undulating line forms the basis of his system.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>In the print of Columbus there is evident reference
to the criticisms<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> on what Hogarth called his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>discovery; and in truth the connoisseurs' remarks on
the painter were dictated by a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'similiar spirit'">similar spirit</ins> to those
of the critics on the navigator: they first asserted
there was no such line, and when he had proved that
there was, gave the honour of discovery to Lomazzo,
Michael Angelo, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Previous to this print being published, Mr. Stuart,
generally denominated Athenian Stuart, advertised
that he intended to publish by subscription a book,
entitled <cite>The Antiquities of Athens</cite>, measured and
delineated by himself and Nicholas Revitt, painters
and architects.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The first volume of this excellent
work was published in 1762; it received, and we may
add it deserved, approbation from every man who
had taste enough to relish those stupendous monuments
of ancient art, which the barbarians who now
possess the country either destroy or suffer to moulder
into dust. "To leave a trace behind" was the object
of Stuart's book; but Hogarth had so long accustomed
himself to laugh at the grand gusto of the
Grecian school, that I can readily suppose he at
length thought any plan which might damp the
public ardour for antiquity would be a correction of
national taste.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> With this view he published the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>print now under consideration; and if ridicule were
a test of truth, it must have effected his purpose.
Minute accuracy is the leading feature of Stuart's
book; minute accuracy is the leading point in
Hogarth's satire.</p>

<p>Under the shadowy umbrage of his remarkable
wigs he has introduced several remarkable characters.</p>

<p>Two profiles in the upper row, under the title
"Episcopal," or "Parsonic," are said to be intended
for Doctor Warburton, late Bishop of Gloucester, and
Doctor Samuel Squire, then Bishop of St. David's.</p>

<p>The next row is inscribed "Old Peerian," or
"Aldermanic;" the first face, in every sense <em>full</em>, is
said to be meant for Lord Melcombe; but considering
the class he is placed in, may as well represent some
sagacious alderman of the day. At the opposite end
of the same line is that remarkable winged periwig,
worn by Sir Samuel Fludyer, Lord Mayor of London,
at the coronation.</p>

<p>A row beneath is made up of the "Lexonic," and
under it is the "Composite," or half-natural, and the
"Queerinthian," or Queue de Renard. Even with
them is a barber's block, crowned with a pair of compasses,
and marked "Athenian measure." This I
believe was intended as a caricature of Mr. Stuart,
and considered as such is an overcharged resemblance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Above the block is a table of references, and facing
it a scale, divided into nodules, or noddles; nasos, or
noses; and minutes. To enter fully into the spirit of
this whimsical print, the spectator must be acquainted
with the terms of architecture.</p>

<p>At the bottom is a portrait of her Majesty, distinguished
by the simplicity of her head-dress, and
five right honourable ladies, whose different ranks are
pointed out by their coronets, and who all wear the
<em>tryglyph membretta</em> drop, or neck-lock. Those who
knew their persons will find no difficulty in ascertaining
their respective titles. The bed-chamber
ladies in 1761 were&mdash;Duchess of Ancaster, Duchess
of Hamilton, Countess of Effingham, Countess of
Northumberland, Viscountess Weymouth, Viscountess
Bolingbroke.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> About the centre of the print is the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lest the beauty of these capitals should chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
depend as usual on the delicacy of the engraving, the
author hath etched them with his own hand."</p>

<p>They are etched with spirit, and in spelling&mdash;incorrect
as can be desired by Mr. Hogarth's greatest
enemy. The word Advertisement is, in latter impressions,
corrected by an <em>e</em> being inserted on the
Countess of Northumberland's left shoulder.</p>

<p class="noindent">"There are hardly any two things more essentially
different than character and caricature; nevertheless
they are usually confounded and mistaken
for each other, on which account this explanation is
attempted.</p>

<p>"It has ever been allowed, that when a character
is strongly marked in the living face, it may be considered
as an index of the mind, to express which
with any degree of justness in painting, requires the
utmost efforts of a great master. Now, that which
has of late years got the name of caricature, is, or
ought to be, totally divested of every stroke that hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a tendency to good drawing; it may be said to be a
species of lines that are produced rather by the hand
of chance than of skill: for the early scrawlings of a
child, which do but barely hint an idea of a human
face, will always be found to be like some person or
other, and will often form such a comical resemblance,
as in all probability the most eminent caricatures of
these times will not be able to equal with design;
because their ideas of objects are so much the more
perfect than children's, that they will unavoidably
introduce some kind of drawing: for all the humorous
effects of the fashionable manner of caricaturing
chiefly depend on the surprise we are under at finding
ourselves caught with any sort of similitude in objects
absolutely remote in their kind. Let it be observed,
the more remote in their nature, the greater is the
excellence of these pieces. As a proof of this, I
remember a famous caricature of a certain Italian
singer, that struck at first sight, which consisted only
of a straight perpendicular line, with a dot over it.
As to the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>, it is different from the
foregoing, and signifies nothing more than the exaggerated
outline of a figure, all the parts of which may
be in other respects a perfect and true picture of
human nature. A giant or a dwarf may be called a
common man <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>; so any part, as a nose, or leg,
made bigger or less than it ought to be, is that part
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>, which is all that is to be understood by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>word, injudiciously used to the prejudice of character."&mdash;<em>See</em>
Excess, <cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>, chap. 6.</p>

<p>The unfinished group of heads in the upper part of
this print was added by the author in October 1764,
and was intended as a further illustration of what is
here said concerning character, caricature, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>.
He worked upon it the day before his death, which
happened the 26th of that month.</p>

<p>The system which Mr. Hogarth has laboured to
establish in the above inscription, and which I think
the genuine system, he has not illustrated with his
usual felicity in the print to which it is annexed.</p>

<p>It was published in 1758, and in its first state exhibited
a view of the Court of Common Pleas, and
portraits of the four sages who then sat on that Bench.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Lord Chief-Justice Sir John Willes is the principal
figure; on his right hand is Sir Edward Clive, and on
his left Mr. Justice Bathurst, and the Honourable
William Noel.</p>

<p>In this state the print gave character only; for
though the robes of my Lord Chief-Justice may have
a shade of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>, they in no degree approach to
that caricature which the unfinished group added to
the plate in 1764 was intended to display. Had the
artist lived to finish them, they might have given
weight to his assertions, but in their present state do
not much illuminate his doctrine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>
<p>The picture, from which each of the prints considerably
vary, was originally the property of Sir
George Hay, and is now in the possession of Mr.
Edwards.</p>

<p>In the year 1727, it was performed sixty-three

<p>We are told in Mr. Boswell's <cite>Johnson</cite>, that when
Gay showed this opera to his patron, the late worthy
Duke of Queensberry, his Grace's observation was,
"This is a very odd thing, Gay; it is either a very
good thing, or a very bad thing." It proved the
former, beyond the warmest expectations of the
author or his friends; though Quin, whose knowledge
of the public taste cannot be questioned, was so doubtful
of its success, that he refused to play the part of
Macheath, which was therefore given to Walker. In
the same volumes I learn that Dr. Johnson did not
apprehend that the performance of this opera had the
pernicious influence which is ascribed to it.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> For the
Doctor's talents and virtues I have a reverence bordering
upon idolatry: in questions of morality he can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>seldom be contradicted, and without the strongest conviction
that in this point he is wrong, I should tremble
to dissent from his opinion; but my deductions are
drawn from examples that to me are conclusive.
With three instances that I had an accidental opportunity
of seeing, I was very forcibly impressed. Two
boys, under nineteen years of age, children of worthy
and respectable parents, fled from their friends, and
pursued courses that threatened an ignominious termination
to their lives. After much search they were
found engaged in midnight depredations, and in
each of their pockets was the <cite>Beggars' Opera</cite>.</p>

<p>A boy of seventeen, some years since tried at the
Old Bailey for what there was every reason to think
his first offence, acknowledged himself so delighted
with the spirited and heroic character of Macheath,
that on quitting the theatre he laid out his last guinea
in the purchase of a pair of pistols, and stopped a
gentleman on the highway.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>
<p>The accumulation of similiar facts is not necessary.
Those who think that lively dialogue, and natural
though vulgar repartee, can atone for what gives new
attractions to vice, will, I suppose, continue to sanction
this performance by attending the representation. If
anything could balance the baneful influence it is calculated
to disseminate, Gay must be allowed the praise
of having attempted to stem Italia's liquid stream,
which at that time meandered through every alley,
street, and square in the metropolis; the honour of
having almost silenced the effeminate song of that
absurd exotic, Italian opera, which a little previous to
this time was the grand pursuit of the fashionable
world. For to the dishonour of true taste, to the disgrace
of common sense, the discords and jarrings of
Cuzzoni, Faustina, and Senesino, excited as much attention,
and were entered into with as much party zeal,
as were the political contests between Lord Chatham
and Sir Robert Walpole, or those still more recent,
between Mr. Charles Fox and Mr. William Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The method Gay took to rout this army of unnatural
auxiliaries does great honour to his generalship.
A new disorder had been imported from the
Continent, and like the plague which was wont to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
imported from Turkey, infected our capital. To lay
an embargo upon sound was impossible; to make
an echo perform quarantine, ridiculous!&mdash;he took a
better mode, drew up song against sing-song, and to
the soft sonnetteering stanza of Italy, opposed the
nervous old ballad of Britain. He brought into the
field the whole force of three kingdoms, and took his
tunes from the most popular songs of the ancient
bards of England, Scotland, and Wales. <cite>Britons
strike home</cite> was the word; <cite>Chevy Chase</cite> led the van,
was followed by a <cite>Soldier and a Sailor</cite> singing <cite>All
Joy to great Cæsar</cite>, and chorussed by <cite>Shenkin of a
Noble Race</cite>; when <cite>An old Woman clothed in Gray</cite>,
with a <cite>Bonny Broom</cite> in her hand, swept the whole
swarm of buzzing caterpillars <cite>Over the Hills and far
away</cite>. Goldoni's opera, <span class="smcap">i Viaggiatori Ridicoli
tornati in Italia</span>,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> was in a degree realized.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>For Italian music, William Hogarth had about as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>much respect as John Gay, and was therefore so well
pleased with a subject which threw it into ridicule,
that he not only painted it three times, but has in
several of his miscellaneous prints made these senseless
sounds one great object of his satire.</p>

<p>The picture from which this is copied was painted
in the year 1729, for Mr. Rich of Covent Garden
Theatre; at the sale of his effects in 1762, it was
purchased by the late Duke of Leeds,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and is at this
time (1806) in the collection of the noble peer who
now bears that title. When the late Duke permitted
Messrs. Boydell to copy it, the print was engraved by
Mr. Blake. To these volumes is annexed an outline
descriptive of the characters, which it is therefore unnecessary
to enumerate in this page.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> They afford a
good example of the dresses, and what was then called
the dignified manner, of the old school. That any
woman should admire such a figure as Mr. Walker in
Macheath, must excite a degree of astonishment; but
to believe for a moment that so attractive a female as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>Miss Fenton would choose such an Adonis,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> must,
even in the year 1727, require a very large portion of
dramatic faith. Her charms have fascinated the
Duke of Bolton: his eye is fixed on her face, and his
mind wholly engrossed by the contemplation of that
beauty which he afterwards made his own. Mr. Rich,
and Mr. Cock the auctioneer, are properly enough
represented as totally inattentive to the scene. The
poet immediately behind them, saturated by public
approbation, pays no greater regard to the performance
than is displayed by the manager. It had
made <em>Gay rich</em>, and <em>Rich gay</em>, and that was sufficient.</p>

<p>As Hogarth was invariably faithful in delineating
what he saw, I dare believe the characters are represented
as they were. Considered in that point, without
regard to other merit, it has quite as much value
as many groups of portraits which are published in
this our day, and denominated "Historical Pictures."</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1729, Hogarth painted
for a Sir Archibald Grant two original pictures, "The
Committee,"<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and the "Beggars' Opera;" but though
Sir Archibald paid half-price for them at the time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>gave the order, I cannot positively assert that they
were ever in his possession, for they afterwards got
into the hands of Mr. Huggins, at the sale of whose
effects the latter was purchased by Doctor Monkhouse,
of Queen's College, Oxford. It has a frame with a
carved bust of Gay at the top. The late Horace
Lord Orford had a sketch of a scene in the same
play.</p>

<p class="noindent">The scene of Hogarth's last drama was Newgate;
and in this it is a Mexican prison, where his pigmy
personages are playing their little parts in one of
Dryden's heroic tragedies.</p>

<p>That these minor performers should prefer rhyme
to prose, I can readily conceive&mdash;the jingling of verse
is a great help to your short memory; but that
Dryden, "the great high priest of all the Nine,"
should so far deviate from nature and outrage common
sense as thus to fetter his dramatic dialogue,
is to be accounted for on no other principle than
the vile taste of Charles the Second's vile Court. The
play is dedicated to the most excellent and most
illustrious Princess Anne, Duchess of Monmouth and
Buccleuch, wife to the most illustrious and high-born
James Duke of Monmouth; and by that dedication<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
appears to have been warmly patronized by the most
eminent persons of wit and honour.</p>

<p>It is a sequel to the <cite>Indian Queen</cite>, written by
Dryden and Sir Robert Howard, which was published
two years before. Of this connection between the
two tragedies, notice was given to the audience by
printed bills distributed at the door,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>&mdash;an expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
which the Duke of Buckingham very happily ridicules
in <cite>The Rehearsal</cite>, when Bayes boasts of the number
of bills he has printed, to instil into the audience some
conception of his plot. By the age of the warlike
William of Cumberland, I conjecture that these embryotic
heroes and heroines strutted away their little
hour about the year 1731; and though the play
which they are enacting is beneath the blazing genius
of John Dryden, it is well worthy the puny powers
of these puny performers.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Lady Sophia Fermor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
who plays the part of Almeria, in 1744 married Lord
Granville, and died in 1750. The prompter was a
Mr. T. Hill; and though this reverend gentleman is
in rather too conspicuous a situation, he is not quite
so obtrusive an object as the prompter at the Opera
House. The governess playing with one of the children
was Lady Deloraine. Miss Conduit, who appears as
Alibeck, was daughter to Catherine, the niece of Sir
Isaac Newton, and in 1740 married Lord Lymington,
eldest son to John first Earl of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The names and additions of three of the auditors are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
inserted under the small print. One of the figures
has a resemblance to the courtly Lord Chesterfield.
Upon the chimney-piece is the bust of Sir Isaac
Newton, and it is fair to conjecture that the two
framed portraits represent Mr. and Mrs. Conduit.</p>

<p>The figure leaning on the back of a chair is said to
be intended for the Duke of Montagu; and the two in
the background, for the Duke and Duchess of Richmond.</p>

<p>Hogarth's original painting is the property of
Lord Holland.</p>

<h3>THE END.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_306.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">The writer of this catalogue is now come to
his last chapter, and has before him the
last plate that Hogarth engraved, which is
properly denominated the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Finis</i> to that great painter's
works.</p>

<p>Of the various opinions which the numerous readers
of these his volumes will form at this his conclusion,
he can have no certain judgment; but fears that some
of them may be thus anticipated.</p>

<p>The votary of comedy, who considers Hogarth as a
mere burlesque painter, with whom he only wishes to
laugh, will deem this book too grave; while the saturnine
spirit, that looks at him as a mere sermonic
moralist, will say it is not grave enough. The man
who supposes that every character was individual,
and expects the scandalous chronicle of those who
were satirized by the artist, will probably complain
that there is too little anecdote; while he that considers
this as a frivolous, gossiping, and anecdotish
age, will say there is too much.</p>

<p>Some will observe that these volumes are too long,
and in the style of a tired mariner, exult that they see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
land. In this their exultation the writer most sincerely
participates, but at the same time acknowledges
(so predominant is vanity) that he trusts there are
who would not regret if the work were still longer,
who will correct what they find erroneous without
triumphing in their superior sagacity, and candidly
forgive the writer's weakness without too much glorying
in their own strength.</p>

<p>From the pedantic and quizzical connoisseur I expect
no mercy, but suppose that the book and the
writer will be arraigned and condemned in manner
and form following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I took up these volumes with the expectation of
seeing all the characters that Hogarth introduced determined,
and all his variations recorded. With respect
to the characters, some are mistaken, and others
are omitted; and as to the variations, few are noticed.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Concerning a multitude of invaluable prints, which
have singly produced three times as much as the
volume of his prints in their present state sells for,
there is not even a catalogue; there are many pages
of extraneous matter, which I had not patience to
read; every iota of Hogarth I understood without
the assistance of this book."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>With all possible humility the author declareth,
that for your use or benefit he did not compile it.</p>

<p class="pfs80">"Laugh where you may, be candid where you can."</p>

<p>That you may know some of the characters of
which the writer is ignorant, he willingly acknowledges;
that you may guess at many, where he sees
no ground for conjecture, he cheerfully admits; and
that both you and himself are very frequently mistaken,
he firmly believes.</p>

<p>The prints are described as they are copied from
the present state of the plates, and the material
alterations incidentally noticed. However great the
merit of the tankards and teapots, the waiters and
coats of arms, to reduce them did not come into the
present plan; to commemorate them was unnecessary.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
The author of these volumes, from the day
he has written man, inspected the works of Hogarth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>with delight, but was not fully conscious of their
superlative merit until the compilation of these remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in the progress of which his duty to the public
obliged him to examine their design, and endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
to illustrate their tendency. In this he has engaged
with the consciousness that there would be error,&mdash;which
to such a work is necessarily attached.</p>

<p>To those readers who are not too fastidious to
peruse it with this allowance, or who have not hitherto
looked at Hogarth with the attention he merits, it
is addressed. If it impels them to more minute inspection
of his works, the purpose is answered.</p>

<p>Yes, great and unrivalled genius! every contemplation
of thy works must be succeeded by admiration!</p>

<p class="noindent">In five compartments beneath the title are the following
inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the dexter corner is a pyramidical shell inscribed:
"The conic form in which the Goddess of
Beauty was worshipped by the ancients at Paphos
in the Island of Cyprus. See the medal struck when
a Roman emperor visited the temple."</p>

<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simulacrum Deæ non effigie humana, continuus

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<p>In the sinister corner is a white pyramid, round
which is twisted the favourite serpentine line inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A copy of the precise line of Beauty, as it is
represented on the first explanatory plate of the
'Analysis of Beauty.'"</p>

<p>"Venus a Paphiis colitur, cujus simulacrum nulli rei
magis assimile, quam albæ Pyramidi."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximus

<p class="p1" />
<p>"<em>Note.</em>&mdash;The similarity of these two conic figures
did not occur to the author till two or three years
after the publication of the <cite>Analysis</cite> in 1754."</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>Thus conclude the inscriptions. We will next inquire
into the motives by which the artist was actuated,
and the subjects he has intended to satirize in this
his concluding enigmatical and pun-ical print.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The labours of this great painter to the passions
are now at an end; and this is the last page of his
eventful and instructive histories. Those which he
had formed into a series, added to the single prints,
portraits, etc., had become so numerous as to form
a large volume. A concluding plate seemed necessary;
and we are told that, a few months before he
was seized with that malady which deprived society
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>of one of its greatest ornaments, he had in contemplation
a last engraving. After a dinner with a few
social friends at his own table, enjoying</p>

<p class="pfs80">"The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,"</p>

<p class="noindent">the board crowned with wine, and each glass circulating
convivial cheerfulness, he was asked, "What
will be the subject of your next print?" "The end
of all things!" was his reply. "If that should be the
case," added one of his friends, "your business will
be finished, for there will be an end of the painter."
With a look that conveyed a consciousness of approaching
dissolution, and a deep sigh, he answered,
"There will so; and therefore, the sooner my work
is done the better." With this impulse he next day
began this plate, and seeming to consider it as a terminus
to his fame, never turned to the right or left
until he arrived at the end of his journey.</p>

<p>The aim of this <em>Omega</em> to his own alphabet was
twofold; to bring together every object which denoted
the end of time, and throw a ridicule upon the
bathos and profundity of the ancient masters.</p>

<p>That the bathos is not confined to the poet, but
hath at sundry times and in divers manners been of
sovereign use to the painter, I am well convinced.
My opinion was originally formed upon the inspection
of many ancient and modern pictures, innumerable
volumes of ancient and modern prints, and an annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
attendance at the Royal Exhibition: it was confirmed
by the perusal of some papers on the arts, which
came into my possession by one of those fortunate
accidents that happen to few men above once in their
lives. Walking some years ago through Harp Alley,
I observed a porter carrying an old trunk without
a cover, in which was a little picture in a broad and
deep ebony frame, a few mutilated pamphlets, a parcel
of prints, and an old manuscript volume bound in
vellum. He laid down his load at a broker's shop;
I inspected it, and seeing the book inscribed "Mart.
Scrib.," purchased the whole lot, took a hackney coach,
and joyfully conveyed my prize home. Eagerly inspecting
the contents, I found the picture was Dutch,
and turned to a tint sombre as the frame: by the
help of clear water I brought out the colours, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs80">"Oh! Jephtha, judge of Israel,&mdash;what a treasure!"</p>

<p class="noindent">To have painted it, must have been the labour of
a long life. Such a green stall!&mdash;such a cabbage!&mdash;a
cauliflower!&mdash;a string of Spanish onions!&mdash;a
bunch of carrots!&mdash;a lobster!&mdash;a brass kettle!&mdash;and
a sunflower!&mdash;I never beheld before. So clear!
transparent! vivid!&mdash;It was forcible as Rembrandt!
brilliant as Rubens!&mdash;and for finishing&mdash;the most
accurate works of Denner!&mdash;the most delicate pencilling
of the Chevalier Vanderweff!&mdash;compared with
this charming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableau</i>, would appear hasty sketches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The pamphlets were German, and touched of the
transmutation of metals; to discover which, who
can calculate the loads of charcoal that have been
burnt, the retorts that have been burst, or the heads
that have been turned? That this grand arcanum of
nature will at some future day be revealed, I have
no doubt; and there is little reason to fear but the
benefit of the discovery will be reaped by this island;&mdash;because,
Britain is highly favoured by the gods;
and several great calculators have clearly proved,
that without some such miraculous assistance, Britain
must be undone by her enormous national debt.</p>

<p>The prints were Flemish; but these subjects are
foreign to my manuscript. First craving pardon for
the digression, to that I proceed.</p>

<p>By time<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> it was turned to the colour of old parchment,
but that it was written by the righte cunnynge
hand of Martinus Scriblerus there can be little doubt.</p>

<p>When he sent some literary memoranda to Arbuthnot,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
he recommended to the Doctor "the recovery of
others which lay straggling about the world."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Let it be also remembered, that though this prodigy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>of science presented to our English Cervantes
numerous tracts, he might not think the Doctor
would have a proper value for those on painting.
That Martinus was a competent judge of the fine
arts, is proved by his fifth chapter on Sinking in
Poetry. Now as the family of the Scribleri, with
all their alliances and collateral relations, have time
immemorial been distinguished for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cacoëthes scribendi</i>
of whatever he was a judge, certes he would
write, and that which he hath written I have happily
preserved. A few extracts<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> which I have inserted
will give a general idea of the whole, which is entitled,
<span class="smcap">The Art of Sinking in Painting</span>; and is thus
introduced in the <cite>Prolegomena</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Great and manifold have been the benefits (my
dear countryman) which poesy hath derived from
that innumerable army of critics and commentators,
who fabricated fences to keep her in bounds, and
bore blazing torches to irradiate her path. Lamentable
is it to consider how few lights have been held
out to her sister art; who, notwithstanding an equal
or prior claim, hath been suffered to wander through
her dreary night with no other illumination than the
glow-worm on the bank, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> in the
ditches. For the use and service of the poet there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
an ocean of commentary; while the painter hath no
other stream in which to slake his thirst for instruction
than that which creeps among the weeds in the
meadow, or gurgles over the pebbles in the valley.</p>

<p>"From intense application to the mysterious tablets
of my great ancestors, for ages professors of astrology
and chemistry in the universities of Germany, I am
empowered to see by anticipation.</p>

<p>"For me it is decreed to strike the rock of nature
with the rod of science, and liberate the fountain of
truth, whose waters shall fertilize this ungenial isle.
Ye whose well-poised pinions enable you to soar
above this our terrestrial globe, and dip your pencils
in the rainbow! come and contemplate the magic
mirror of Martinus Scriblerus.</p>

<p>"Conscious am I that this our divine muse, who
hath not unaptly been styled journeywoman to
Nature, is now in a profound sleep; but in the coming
century she shall awake from her trance, shake
the dust from her many-coloured mantle, and dazzle
the surrounding nations. Blest with the power of
penetrating the cloud of time, which is impervious to
vulgar sight, I see, as in a vision, the wonders of
another age; and should these my lucubrations be
neglected by my contemporaries, happy am I in the
confidence that by their posterity they will be properly
estimated, and sought for as were the Sibyl's
leaves, regarded as the oracles of Apollo, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>sidered
as the touchstone of true taste. To the age
of whom they are worthy, and who are worthy of
them, I dedicate these my labours.</p>

<p>"The few who have written upon the fine arts
have endeavoured to inculcate simplicity of action,
anatomical correctness, symmetry of parts, harmony
of colouring, easy folding of drapery, and due attention
to the grouping of figures. These rules can only
be classed among the idle dreams of visionary speculation;
resign yourselves unto my guidance, and
listen unto the lessons of truth.</p>

<p>"In every animal there is an original instinct, tending
towards that for which it was by nature designed.
In man, there is a natural bias to the bathos; but
he must be instructed, or rather compelled into any
relish or taste for what is denominated the sublime.</p>

<p>"To prove this my position, show a collection of
drawings or paintings to a child: it will be irresistibly
attracted by glittering colours, forced expressions,
and grotesque, or what are commonly called caricatured
countenances. Let the savage, who is not
vitiated by idle rules, and has never seen painted
canvas, be taken into a picture-gallery,&mdash;his natural
taste will lead him to similar objects. What the
artists call a quiet picture, he will quietly pass; but
let the figures be crowded, the attitudes extravagant,
and the colours gaudy,&mdash;his attention and admiration
are ensured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"These facts being admitted, and they cannot be
denied, why should we not take the genuine undebauched
disposition of man in his original state of
simplicity, as a better criterion of truth than that
ideal nature which hath misled many painters and
writers; of whose fantastic dogmas I cannot too
strongly caution you to beware. Should you, in the
course of your early studies, have contracted any of
this ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ærugo</i>,&mdash;it is corrosive,&mdash;consider it as
the dross of science, and scatter it in the air, for with
my precepts it cannot coalesce. Ideal beauty is a
childish absurdity. Painting is, or ought to be, an
imitation of nature; and that can never be a good
picture which representeth things that never did or
can exist."</p></div>

<p>After many more pages to the same purport, this
great philosopher divideth his subject. The table of
contents to a few of his chapters, which will give a
general idea of his plan, is hereunto annexed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Chap. 1.</span>&mdash;<em>Of the Story.</em></p>

<p>"The principal character in your piece should be
an illustrious person; but as great men may sometimes,
for their recreation and diversion, or worse
purposes, be taken up in mean and trivial matters, in
such situations, it is proved from many right worthy
examples, they may and ought to be delineated.
The Emperor Domitian should be represented killing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
flies; Nero, playing upon the fiddle; Julius Cæsar,
kicking a football; and Commodus, at a bull-baiting.</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Chap. 2.</span>&mdash;<em>Relateth unto the Allegory.</em></p>

<p>"To raise an historical picture above vulgar expression,
it should be seasoned with allegory, and
elevated with metaphorical allusions and figures.</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Chap. 3.</span>&mdash;<em>Of the Time.</em></p>

<p>"In this there should be variety; and if your story
have not a sufficient number of great and famous
persons to render it important and interesting, you
may embellish it with such portraitures as suit your
purpose. Their not having lived in the same age or
nation is of little import.</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Chap. 4.</span>&mdash;<em>Of the Machinery.</em></p>

<p>"The machinery, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est</i>, the celestial and infernal
powers, must be brought into your picture on every
great or difficult occasion. This will not only give
your delineation a classical and learned air, but account
for any wonderful action which the world
might think your hero could not perform without
supernatural assistance.</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Chap. 5.</span>&mdash;<em>Treateth of the Episode.</em></p>

<p>"To vary the pleasure of the spectator, an historical
picture should be diversified with an episode; especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
care being taken that it have no congruity with the
main subject; for the name deriveth from that which
is superadded to the original plan, and ought no more
to appear a part of it than an insect appeareth as a
part of the animal unto which it adhereth.</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Chap. 6.</span>&mdash;<em>Describeth the nature and end of the
Hyperbola, or Impossible.</em></p>

<p>"This image is of eminent use in giving a cast of
grandeur and greatness to what would, without it,
appear trivial and mean. It excites astonishment;
and the majority of mankind being most delighted
with that which is most marvellous, is a good and
sufficient cause for your works being well strewed
with wonders."</p></div>

<p>For the contents of eighteen succeeding chapters,
treating of the cumbrous, the inflated, the glittering,
the infantine, the pun-ical, the vulgar, and sundry
other styles, I have not room, but quitting the bathos
of Martinus Scriblerus, must proceed unto that of
William Hogarth.</p>

<p>It is well worthy of the title, for a more heterogeneous
compound of ludicrous and serious objects
was never displayed in one print.</p>

<p>Some of his images the artist has gleaned from the
common field of the poor company of punsters, and
for others hath soared into the lofty regions of mythological
allegory. He ascends from an inch of candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
setting fire to a print, to the chariot of the sun, which,
with Apollo Pæan and his three fiery coursers, sinks
into endless night. Mounts from the cobbler's end,
twisted round a wooden last, to the world's end, elegantly
exemplified by a bursting globe on an alehouse
sign. He has contrasted the worn-out brush
with the broken crown; and opposed to the empty
purse a commission of bankrupt, which, sanctioned
with the great seal of a hero upon a white horse, is
issued and awarded against Nature,&mdash;by Heaven
knows who! He has joined the huge cracked bell of
the cathedral to the broken bottle of the tavern; and
set in opposition to the mutilated column and capital
of Ionia, the rope's end of a man-of-war. The bow
which, drawn by the old English archer, gave force
fraught with death to the barbed arrow, is unstrung
and broken. The mutilated firelock, divested of its
tube, shall no more thin the ranks of contending
armies. The tottering tower, funeral yew, death's
head, cross-bones, and "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic jacet</i>" of a country
churchyard, are opposed by the hard-worn besom,
blighted oaks, falling sign-post, and unthatched cottage.
In what painters call the sky, we have not only
the son of Latona, but Luna in a veil: in the distance
a ship is sinking into the bed of the ocean, and a
gibbet is erected on the shore; to this, in conformity
with the wise institutions of our polished ancestors,
and for the luxury of those strong-beaked birds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>

<p>The print of "The Times," that gave rise to so
much unmerited abuse of this wonderful painter and
excellent man, is in a blaze. The palette on which

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Hogarth might intend by this, and the improprieties and violations
of order in the unfinished building seen out of a window, to hint at the
absurdities of the then fashionable architect, William Kent. As a
painter Kent was beneath satire, as an architect he was above it;
but he was protected by Lord Burlington, patronized by Lord Pembroke,
and employed by all who aspired to a character for <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtu</i>.
Hogarth saw with disgust bordering upon indignation that his taste in
one art, modern gardening (of which he was the acknowledged father),
procured him the reputation of excellence in another, in which he was
grossly ignorant and glaringly erroneous. In some of the grounds laid
out by Kent's directions, he realized that Paradise which Milton had
described; his patrons saw that he could improve nature in their plantations,
and very kindly gave him credit for a power which he never
possessed&mdash;that of giving an imitation of nature on his canvas. By the
Dryades his sacrifice had been accepted; but the offering he laid upon
the altar sacred to the fine arts was rejected with disdain. It was the
praise of Hercules that he destroyed monsters and discomfited giants;
it was the praise of William Kent that he cleared our gardens of their
representatives. Before his time the plantations round the seats of our
nobility were a kind of vernal menagerie: the lion shook his shaggy
mane in yew; the dragon waved his wings in evergreen; and in box,
the wild boar displayed his bristled neck and tusks terrific. Our
disciple of true taste cleared away these fantastic forms, and in their
place gave us nature,&mdash;"nature to advantage dressed." But when
consulted about interior decorations, his taste evaporated. The heavy
canopy over the nobleman's head, the ponderous chairs and massy
frames which decorate the room, are from his designs. In some of
the old houses of our ancient nobility we see furniture of a similar
appearance, though the greatest part of it, after passing through the
purgatory of a broker's shop, has either been placed in very inferior
situations or consigned to the flames.
</p>
<p>
Of Kent's abilities as a painter the public thought so highly, that he
was absurdly enough opposed to Sir James Thornhill. This circumstance
might be one source of Hogarth's dislike; he, however, took an
early opportunity of showing it, by what is called a "Burlesque of Kent's
Altarpiece at St. Clement's Church," but which Hogarth declared to be
a fair delineation of the original. A reduced copy is in vol. iii. of this
work; see p. 17 of the 2d edition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Some of the portraits of Louis <span class="fs80">XIV.</span> are quite as absurd. We are
told that he once sent to Rome for Poussin, to paint him in the character
of Jupiter. This great artist obeyed the summons, and prepared
his canvas and colours; when, to his extreme astonishment, the monarch
informed him that, although he was to be delineated as the representative
of Jove, etiquette did not permit him to appear without his major
peruke, and he must consequently be so painted. Poussin, not able to
conceive any way of giving appropriate dignity to the thunderer of
Olympus with this flowing appendage, declined beginning the picture,
and returned to Rome without making his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> By the loose negligence of her habit, and some circumstances, I am
inclined to think the artist intended to represent her as pregnant. It
has been said that after Baron had finished the plate, Mr. Hogarth
added a lock of hair with Indian ink, but after a few impressions were
taken off, inserted this supplemental ornament with the graver. In his
<cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>, he makes a remark which in some degree accounts
for the introduction of this fascinating attraction:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"It was once the fashion to have two curls of equal size, stuck at the
same height close upon the forehead, which probably took its rise from
seeing the pretty effect of curls falling loosely over the face.
</p>
<p>
"A lock of hair falling thus across the temples, and by that means
breaking the regularity of the oval, has an effect too alluring to be
strictly decent, as is very well known to the loose and lowest classes of
women; but being paired in so stiff a manner as they formerly were,
they lost the desired effect, and ill deserved the name of ornaments."
</p>
<p>
Moralists of different nations have considered hair as calculated to
entangle hearts, and one of our pious writers of the last century wrote
a furious treatise on the <em>un</em>loveliness of love-locks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> A chair kicked down, an <cite>Essay on Whist</cite>, cards scattered on the
floor, and the general confusion of everything in the room, seem to
intimate that this <em>right honourable society</em> were actuated by passions
somewhat similar to those which inflame the gentlemen in the sixth
plate of "The Rake's Progress." Though a genuine gamester is not apt
to lose his presence of mind on slight occasions, yet when a man of
rank is stripped of sums that will draw into their vortex many anticipated
years of his revenue, he is liable to lose his temper, and on such
occasions apt to vent his spleen on inanimate objects. Such things
sometimes happen even now.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Absurd as this may seem, yet until Mr. Wedgwood introduced
those beautiful Etruscan forms which now decorate the rooms, and form
the taste of the possessors, these shapeless monsters disgraced the most
splendid apartments in the metropolis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> "Kent was not only consulted for furniture, as frames of pictures,
glasses, tables, chairs, etc., but for plate, for a barge, for a cradle. So
impetuous was fashion, that two great ladies prevailed on him to make
designs for their birthday gowns. The one he dressed in a petticoat
decorated with columns of the five orders; the other, like a bronze, in
copper-coloured satin, with ornaments of gold."&mdash;Walpole's <cite>Anecdotes</cite>,

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> It is said to have been designed for the once celebrated Betty Careless,
and the remark is supposed to be countenanced by the initials
E. C. on her bosom. This woman, by a transmigration as natural as
is that of the chrysalis, from being one of the most fashionable of the
Cyprian corps, became keeper of a brothel; and after repeated arrests
and many imprisonments, was buried from the poorhouse of St. Paul's,
Covent Garden, April 22, 1752. In many of the elegant Latin odes of
Loveling her name is immortalized; and of her person and appearance
Fielding thus speaks in his <cite>Amelia</cite>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I happened in my youth to sit behind two ladies in a side-box at a
play, where, in a balcony on the opposite side, was placed the inimitable
Betsy Careless, in company with a young fellow of no very formal or
indeed sober appearance. One of the ladies, I remember, said to the
other, 'Did you ever see anything look so modest and so innocent as
that girl over the way? What pity it is such a creature should be in the
way of ruin, as I am afraid she is by being alone with that young fellow.'
</p>
<p>
"Now this lady was no bad physiognomist: for it was impossible to
conceive a greater appearance of modesty, innocence, and simplicity
than what nature had displayed in the countenance of that girl, and yet,
all appearances notwithstanding, I myself (remember, critic, it was in
my youth) had, a few mornings before, seen that very identical picture
of those engaging qualities in bed with a rake at a bagnio, smoking
tobacco, drinking punch, talking obscenity, and swearing and cursing
with all the impudence and impiety of the lowest and most abandoned
trull of a soldier."
</p>
<p>
Hogarth noticed this woman in a former print: one of the madmen
in the last plate of "The Rake's Progress" has written "Charming
Betsy Careless" on the rail of the stairs, and wears her portrait suspended
to a riband tied round his neck. Mrs. Heywood's <cite>Betsy
Thoughtless</cite> was in <span class="fs80">MS.</span> entitled <cite>Betsy Careless</cite>; but, from the infamy at
that time annexed to the name, had a new baptism. There are those
who say that the letters upon this woman's bosom are not E. C. but
F. C., and intended to designate Fanny Cock, daughter of Mr. Cock
the auctioneer, with whom the artist had a casual disagreement. After
all these conjectures, I think it is probable that these gunpowder initials
are merely the marks of a woman of the lowest rank and most infamous
description.</p></div>

the artist intended to hint that this gentleman died for the good of his
country; but from the records of some of our mortuary historians, it
appears that about the time this set of prints were published, a number
of bodies thus preserved, which had been exsiccated by some mode of
embalming at present unknown, were discovered in a vault in Whitechapel
Church.</p></div>

who, after he had stolen it, sold it to the Consul of Alexandria, by whom
it was transmitted to England: and a right grave antiquary quotes a
passage in Sandys' <cite>Travels</cite> to prove its being genuine; where that
learned and accurate voyager assures us that he saw the sepulchre
empty, "which agrees exactly," saith he, "with the theft above
mentioned." He omits to observe that Herodotus tells the same thing
of it in his time.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> A short time before the publication of these prints, the greatest part
of our nobility acted as if they had been bitten by a tarantula. The
sums lavished upon exotic warblers would have supported an army; the
applause bestowed upon some of them would have turned the brain of a
saint. It was little short of adoration. Persons of inferior rank caught
this jingling contagion, and all orders of the people were infected with
a musical mania, totally foreign to our national taste, and highly dishonourable
to our national character. In one of Hogarth's former
prints is a list of the rich presents Signior Farinelli, the Italian singer,
condescended to accept from the English nobility and gentry for one
night's performance in the opera of <cite>Artaxerxes!</cite> comprising gold snuff-boxes,

have sometimes thought that a decision of the great Frederick of
Prussia's was equally deserving of record. When a list of criminals,
who had forfeited their lives by violating the laws of their country, was
once brought to him to sign, he observed the name of a soldier convicted
of sacrilege.&mdash;"That a soldier of mine should be guilty of so
atrocious a crime," said the king, "astonishes and distresses me. I
will not, however, sign his death-warrant until I have examined him in
person." The man was accordingly brought into the royal presence,
and two monks, who were his accusers, declared that he had come
into their church during the time they were celebrating mass, and
placed himself under an image of the Virgin Mary, from whose shoes
he had privately taken two pearl bows, and carried them out of the
church: they pursued him, and found them in his pocket. The king,
turning to the criminal, desired to know what he had to say in his
defence? which was simply this: that he was a disbanded soldier, and
in great distress for a dinner: that he walked into the churchyard, and
earnestly prayed to the Virgin Mary that she would put him in the way
of getting one: that she appeared to him, and told him she heard his
supplications, and pitied his distress; to relieve which, she begged him
to accept of some pearls which were on the feet of her image in the
neighbouring church. When the doors opened, he walked into the
church and took them out of her shoes, with an intention of converting
them into money. "This," said the king, "alters the face of the
business; but tell me, most reverend fathers, for you undoubtedly
know, is it according to your canons possible that the Virgin could, to
relieve distress and preserve a life, appear to this poor man in the way
he describes?"&mdash;"Undoubtedly, my liege, she could, but it is not
probable that she did." "Is it possible?"&mdash;"Certainly." "Very
well. I will not let a soldier of mine suffer death upon probabilities.
He shall be discharged this time; but observe what I say to you,
young man; if at any future period I find that you accept another
present from either virgin, saint, or angel, you shall be hanged."</p></div>

fashionable winter dish; and it was a standing dish which might be
marched from the pantry to the parlour, and give the semblance of
plenty for forty days. This was perhaps one reason for our votary of
Mammon making it the leading article in his bill of fare; the rest and
residue of his feast is made up by a solitary egg.
</p>
<p>
A boiled egg was the usual dinner of Sir Hans Sloane. When he
once complained to Dr. Mortimer that all his friends had deserted him,
the Doctor observed that Chelsea was a considerable distance from the
residence of most of them, and therefore they might be disappointed
when they came to find he had so slight a dinner. This gentle
remonstrance put the old Baronet in a rage, and he exclaimed, "Keep
a table! Invite people to dinner! Would you have me ruin myself?
Public credit totters already, and if (as has been presaged) there should
be a national bankruptcy, or a sponge to wipe out the national debt,
you may yet see me in a workhouse." His landed estate was at that
time very considerable, and his museum worth much more than the
twenty thousand pounds which was, however, given for it by Parliament.
</p>
<p>
Scanty as is our citizen's dinner, his table-cloth is ample. The
founder of Guy's Hospital, which is the first private foundation in the
world, was not so extravagant. His constant substitute for a table-cloth
was either a dirty proof sheet of some book or an old newspaper.</p></div>

little chimney-sweeper, which had, I dare say, a better effect than a
volume of ethics. The young soot merchant was seated upon an alehouse
bench, and had in one hand his brush, and in the other a hot
buttered roll. While exercising his white masticators with a perseverance
that evinced the highest gratification, he observed a dog lying on
the ground near him. The repetition of "Poor fellow, poor fellow,"
in a good-natured tone, brought the quadruped from his resting-place:
he wagged his tail, looked up with an eye of humble entreaty, and in
that universal language which all nations understand, asked for a morsel
of bread. The sooty tyrant held his remnant of roll towards him; but
on the dog gently offering to take it, struck him with his brush so violent
a blow across the nose as nearly broke the bone. A gentleman who,
unperceived, had been a witness to the whole transaction, put a sixpence
between his finger and thumb, and beckoned this little monarch of
May-day to an opposite door. The lad grinned at the silver, but on
stretching out his hand to receive it, the practical teacher of humanity
gave him such a rap upon the knuckles with a cane as made them ring.
His hand tingling with pain, and tears running down his cheeks, he
asked "What that was for?" "To make you feel," was the reply.
"How do you like a blow and a disappointment?&mdash;the dog endured
both! Had you given him a piece of bread, this sixpence should have
been the reward; you gave him a blow, I will therefore put the money
in my pocket."</p></div>

<p class="pfs70">MALT AND BREWERS.</p>

The duty on malt from July 5, 1785, to the same day 1786, produced
a million and a half of money, from a liquor which invigorates
the bodies of its willing subjects to defend the blessings they enjoy,
while that from Stygian gin enervates and incapacitates.
</p>
<p>
One of the brewers (or Chevaliers de Malte, as an impertinent Frenchman
styled Humphrey Parsons, when the King of France inquired
who he was) within one year contributed fifty thousand pounds to his
own share. The sight of a great London brewery exhibits a magnificence
unspeakable. The vessels evince the extent of the trade. Mr.
Meux of Liquorpond Street can show twenty-four vessels containing
thirty-five thousand four hundred barrels of wholesome liquor, which
enables our London porter-drinkers to perform tasks that ten gin-drinkers
would sink under.</p></div>

your conduct, which I have thought very regular and systematic, but I
really dislike the title you have adopted; I observe that you meet, read
a string of observations, and then make a motion for adjourning to
dinner in the next room; there each man drinks his two bottles to most
patriotic and constitutional toasts. In the next paper appear advertisements,
that on the following Monday the supporters of the Bill of
Rights will meet again. Dinner on table precisely at four o'clock. You
dine, and drink your wine; your secretary gives us the same information
in the succeeding prints, and again adds, that&mdash;dinner will be on
the table precisely at four o'clock. All these circumstances induce me
to think you should alter your title; instead of 'Supporters of the Bill
of Rights,' call yourselves what you really are, 'Supporters of the Bill
of Fare!'"</p></div>

<p>"The next character to whose merits we would do justice is the
Rev. Dr. C&mdash;ss&mdash;t (Cosserat). But as it is very difficult to delineate
this fellow in colours sufficiently strong and lively, it is fortunate for us
and the Doctor that Hogarth has undertaken the task. In the print of
'An Election Entertainment,' the public will see the Doctor represented
sitting among the freeholders, and zealously eating and drinking for the
sake of the new interest. His venerable and humane aspect will at
once bespeak the dignity and benevolence of his heart. Never did
aldermen at Guildhall devour custard with half such an appearance of
love to his country, or swallow ale with so much the air of a patriot.
These circumstances the pencil of Hogarth will undoubtedly make
manifest; but it is much to be lamented that his words also cannot
appear in this print, and that the artist cannot delineate that persuasive
flow of eloquence which could prevail upon copyholders to abjure their
base tenures and swear themselves freeholders. But this oratory (far
different from the balderdash of Tully and Doctor King, concerning
liberty and our country), as the genius of mild ale alone could inspire,
this fellow alone could deliver."</p></div>

of lime juice, thirteen hundredweight of fine Lisbon sugar, five pounds of
grated nutmegs, three hundred toasted biscuits, and lastly, a pipe of dry

In Mr. Edmund Burke's speech to the electors of Bristol, on the 3d
of November 1774, he gave such cogent reasons for not signing any
engagement to obey in all cases the instructions of his constituents, that
I cannot resist the temptation of inserting an extract, for the contemplation
of those who are advocates of a contrary system:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a
representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence,
and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their
wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion high respect;
their business unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose,
his pleasures, his satisfaction to theirs; and above all, ever and in all
cases to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion,
his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to
sacrifice to you, to any men, or to any set of men living. These he
does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution.
They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which
he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you not only his
industry, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you, if he
sacrifices it to your opinion.
</p>
<p>
"My worthy colleague says his will ought to be subservient to yours.
If that be all, the thing is innocent. If government were a matter of
will upon any side, yours, without question, ought to be superior. But
government and legislation are matters of reason and judgment, and not
of inclination; and what sort of reason is that in which the determination
precedes the discussion, in which one set of men deliberate and
another decide, and where those who form the conclusion are three
hundred miles distant from those who hear the argument?
</p>
<p>
"To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents
is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought
always to rejoice to hear, and which he ought always most seriously to
consider. But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the
member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue
for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience;
these are things utterly unknown to the laws of the land,
which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor
of our constitution.
</p>
<p>
"Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and
hostile interests; which interests each must maintain, as an agent and
advocate against other agents and advocates; but Parliament is a deliberative
assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole;
where not local purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the
general good resulting from the general reason of the whole. You
choose a member, indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not a
member of Bristol, but he is a member of Parliament. If the local
constituent should have an interest, or should form an hasty opinion,
evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community,
the member of that place ought to be as far as any other from
any endeavour to give it effect."</p></div>

<p>"If I was now upon earth&mdash;either nobleman or commoner&mdash;I
should choose peace and quiet, both public and private: I should be
happy in preserving religion and morality among my countrymen, instead
of suborning them to take the oath falsely about bribery and
corruption; debauching their minds, by giving them money that is of
no use to their families, and keeping them in continual drunkenness,
that renders them incapable of serving themselves or their country.
</p>
<p>
"To this I attribute the loss of that which was common in my time,
but in yours is found only in romances and novels&mdash;I mean simplicity
of manners among the country people. Rustic innocence was then as
common among the men as among the women; but there is scarce any
mode of vice or folly which is not at this period equally known and
practised by both sexes; and in the most obscure villages to as great a
degree as in the most polished cities. Let us consider that a million of
money was spent in treats and bribery at the last general election; and
if we take into the calculation the contested elections, for some of which
there were three or four candidates, and the money that is spent by their
friends on these occasions, we shall not find the computation too high.
What place, then, will not the influence of this immense sum extend to?
Not even the smallest hamlet can escape; and you may as well look
for purity of manners, innocence and simplicity, among the Capuans of
old, or in your Covent Garden, as in any place that an election guinea
has found its way to.&mdash;I am, etc."</p></div>

in his power, recommend him to be a bishop, because that was a
business in which preaching was not wanted, but in a curate it was
wanted every week. Being once asked by one of his parishioners
which of two candidates he would advise him to vote for as a Parliament
man, in a warmly contested Irish election, Swift desired he would
first consider what was the business of a Parliament man; and secondly,
which of the parties was best qualified for that business; and then he
would want no advice. If your vote, added he, could make a lord
or a duke, as they are people who need not do any business at all,
you might toss up a halfpenny, and vote for the man who came up

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> The life of Andrew Marvel forms a fine contrast to the life of a
modern patriot. He was the son of a clergyman who resided at
Kingston-upon-Hull, in Yorkshire, at which town he was born in the
year 1624. His first appearance in public business was as an assistant
to John Milton, when that inspired poet was Latin secretary to the
Protector. A little before the Restoration he was chosen representative
for his native town, and afterwards re-elected for the same place, and
had a seat in that Parliament which began at Westminster, May 8,
1661. In this station he discharged his trust with the utmost fidelity,
and always displayed a particular regard for those by whom he was
elected; for he regularly sent the particulars of every proceeding in the
House to the heads of the town which he represented, and to these
accounts always joined his own opinion. This gained so much upon
their affections, that they allowed him an honourable pension during
the whole time he sat in Parliament, which was until his death. By
his actions and writings he rendered himself obnoxious to the ruling
powers; notwithstanding which, Charles the Second much delighted in
his company. Having one evening passed some hours with this good-humoured
monarch, his Majesty next morning sent Lord Treasurer
Danby to find out his lodgings. Mr. Marvel's apartments were up two
pair of stairs, in a little court in the Strand, where he was writing when
the Lord Treasurer rather abruptly opened the door. Surprised at so
unexpected a visitor, Mr. Marvel told his Lordship he believed he had
mistaken his way. Lord Danby replied, "Not, now I have found Mr.
Marvel;" adding, "I come with a message from his Majesty, who
wishes to know what he can do to serve you." "I know," replied
Marvel, "the nature of courts too well to lay myself under the obligation;
for whoever is distinguished by a prince's favours, is certainly
expected to vote in his interest." Lord Danby told him that his
Majesty was sensible of his merits, and on that account alone desired
to know if there were any place at Court which he would be pleased
with. These offers, though urged with the greatest earnestness, had
no effect. He told the nobleman, that to accept them with honour was
impossible; because, added he, "I must either be ungrateful to the
King in voting against him, or false to my country in giving in to the
measures of the Court. The only favour therefore which I beg of his
Majesty is, that he will esteem me to be as dutiful a subject as any he
has; and more in his proper interest by refusing these offers than if I
had accepted them." The Lord Danby, finding that no argument
would prevail, told him that the King had ordered him a thousand
pounds, which he requested him to receive as a token of royal favour.
This last offer was rejected with the same stedfastness as the first,
though, soon after the Lord Treasurer was gone, he was under the
necessity of sending to a friend to borrow a guinea. The greatest
temptations of riches or honours could never bribe him to depart from
what he thought the interest of his country, neither could the most
imminent dangers deter him from pursuing it.
</p>
<p>
He died, not without strong suspicions of being poisoned, August the
16th, 1678, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and was interred in the
Church of St. Giles' in the Fields. Highly to the honour of the
inhabitants of Kingston-upon-Hull, they in the year 1683 contributed a
sum of money for a monument to the memory of this best of men and
most incorruptible of senators; but the then minister of St. Giles'
forbade its being erected in that church, on account of the following
epitaph which was inscribed on it:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Near this place lieth the body of Andrew Marvel, Esq., a man
so endowed by nature, so improved by education, study, and travel;
so consummated by experience and learning, that joining the most
peculiar graces of wit with a singular penetration and strength of
judgment, and exercising all these in the whole course of his life with
unalterable steadiness in the ways of virtue, he became the ornament
and example of his age; beloved by good men, feared by bad, admired
by all, though imitated, alas, by few, and scarce paralleled by any.
But a tombstone can neither contain his character, nor is marble
necessary to transmit it to posterity; it is engraved in the minds of this
generation, and will be always legible in his inimitable writings.
Nevertheless, he having served near twenty years successively in
Parliament, and that with such wisdom, dexterity, integrity, and
courage as became a true patriot, the town of Kingston-upon-Hull,
from whence he was constantly returned to that assembly, lamenting in
his death the public loss, have erected this monument of their grief and
gratitude.

delineation; it is, however, curious: "The form of a Frenchman is
different from that of all other nations, and difficult to describe in words.
No other man has so little of the firm or deep traits, or so much motion.
He is all appearance, all gesture; therefore the first impression seldom
deceives, but declares who and what he is. His imagination is incapable
of high flights; and the sublime in all arts is to him offence. Hence
his dislike of whatever is antique in art or literature, his deafness to
true music, his blindness to the highest beauties of painting. His last
most striking trait is, that he is astonished at everything, and cannot
imagine how it is possible men should be any other than they are at
Paris."</p></div>

in the month of May performed the character of Lear, he in the first
four acts received the customary tribute of applause. At the conclusion
of the fifth, when he wept over the body of Cordelia, every eye caught
the soft infection&mdash;the big round tear ran down every cheek. At this
interesting moment, to the astonishment of all present, his face assumed
a new character, and his whole frame appeared agitated by a new passion:
it was not tragic, for he was evidently endeavouring to suppress
a laugh. In a few seconds the attendant nobles appeared to be affected
in the same manner; and the beauteous Cordelia, who was reclined
upon a crimson couch, opening her eyes to see what occasioned the
interruption, leapt from her sofa, and with the majesty of England, the
gallant Albany, and tough old Kent, ran laughing off the stage. The
audience could not account for this strange termination of a tragedy in
any other way than by supposing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> were seized with
a sudden frenzy; but their risibility had a different source. A fat
Whitechapel butcher, seated on the centre of the front bench in the pit,
was accompanied by his mastiff, who being accustomed to sit on the
same seat with his master at home, naturally thought he might enjoy
the like privilege here. The butcher sat very back, and the quadruped
finding a fair opening, got upon the bench, and fixing his fore-paws on
the rail of the orchestra, peered at the performers with as upright a
head and as grave an air as the most sagacious critic of his day. Our
corpulent slaughter-man was made of melting stuff, and not being
accustomed to a playhouse heat, found himself much oppressed by the
weight of a large and well-powdered Sunday peruke, which, for the
gratification of cooling and wiping his head, he pulled off, and placed
on the head of his mastiff. The dog being in so conspicuous, so obtrusive
a situation, caught the eye of Mr. Garrick and the other performers.
A mastiff in a churchwarden's wig (for the butcher was a
parish officer) was too much: it would have provoked laughter in Lear
himself, at the moment he was most distressed; no wonder, then, that
it had such an effect on his representative.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_108_108" id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> I have inserted the name of Gay on the authority of Mr. Nichols'
<cite>Anecdotes</cite>, in page 177 of which is the following remark from a correspondent:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"That Pope was silent on the merits of Hogarth (as one of your
readers has observed) should excite little astonishment, as our artist's
print on the South Sea exhibits the translator of Homer in no very
flattering point of view. He is represented with one of his hands in the
pocket of a fat personage, who wears a horn-book at his girdle. For
whom this figure was designed is doubtful; perhaps it was meant for
Gay, who was a fat man, and a loser in the scheme, etc. The horn-book
he wears at his girdle perhaps refers to the fables he wrote for the Duke
of Cumberland. The conclusion to the inscription under this plate&mdash;'Guess
at the rest, you'll find out more'&mdash;seems also to imply a consciousness
of such personal satire as it was not prudent to explain."
</p>
<p>
The conjecture that this is designed for Gay is fair, but I think not
quite conclusive. Hogarth would not have represented the translator
of Homer diving into the coat pocket of a brother bard for coin, and
Gay could not be robbed of anything else. May not the label with
A&mdash;B&mdash;, etc., be intended to point out Arbuthnot: he also was a fat
man, and so careless of fame, that he suffered Pope, and some other
eminent contemporary authors, to plunder him of the best part of his
writings, which they afterwards modestly published as their own; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i>
a very large portion of <cite>Martinus Scriblerus</cite>, particularly Pope's own
edition, published in 1742.
</p>
<p>
Pope is again introduced in a print published about the year 1728,
entitled "Rich's Glory, or The Triumphant Entry into Covent Garden,"
improperly said to be the production of Hogarth.</p></div>

but even here a dart must be hurled at the Duke.&mdash;The dart recoils,

to a fault:&mdash;

he one Sunday evening went to the vestry-room, waited until the service
concluded, and then very rudely attacked the clergyman, telling him he
came to convince him, to confound him, and to convert him by the
word! This was followed by the recital of a thousand texts from various
parts of the Holy Scriptures, so combined as to prove whatever he
wished; and concluded by, "This is all from the Bible, and by the Bible
I desires to abide.&mdash;Answer me by the same book." The clergyman
being a man of some humour, after hearing him with much patience,
very coolly asked this labourer in the vineyard if he recollected a text
in the book of Kings, where it is written, "Then Ahithophel set his
house in order, and went and hanged himself." "Certainly," replied
the man, "I know it to be scripture." "Good," added the divine;

"For their being sucked by their familiar, we know so little of the
nature of demons and spirits, that it is no wonder we cannot certainly
divine the reason of so strange an action. And yet we may conjecture
at some things that may render it less improbable. For some have
thought that the Genii (whom both the Platonic and Christian antiquity
thought embodied) are re-created by the reeks and vapours of human
blood, and the spirits that proceed from them: which supposal (if we
grant them bodies) is not unlikely, everything being refreshed and
nourished by its like. And that they are not perfectly abstracted from
all body and matter; besides the reverence we owe to the wisest antiquity,
there are several considerable arguments I could allege to render it
probable: which things supposed, the devil's suckling the sorceress is
no great wonder, nor difficult to be accounted for. Or perhaps this
may be only a diabolical sacrament and ceremony to confirm the hellish

supplies from the fountain of antiquity to take their copious draughts
unmolested, he adopted the creed of his own nation, and on the dim
legends of superstition, and oral traditions of credulity, raised a superstructure

what was done to him. When he was thought to be out of his fits, he
digested nothing that was given him for nourishment, but would often
astonish those present by bringing up thread, straw, crooked pins, nails,
needles, etc. At this period his throat swelled, his tongue grew rigid,
and he appeared to be incapable of speaking.

This juvenile impostor accused a poor honest industrious old woman
of witchcraft, and asserted that she had bewitched him. By his artful
behaviour when she was brought into the room where he was, he raised
in the minds of those about him a strong presumption of his accusations
being founded. Under these impressions, the woman was tried at
Stafford assizes, but the jury had sense enough to acquit her. By the
judge's recommendation, the boy was committed to the care of the
Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, who happened to be present in
court. His Grace took him to his palace at Eccleshall, and there,
having the previous advice of several physicians, intended to try the
effect of severity; but being in the meantime informed that the boy
always fell into violent agitations upon hearing that verse of St. John's
Gospel, "In the beginning was the Word," etc., resolved to try another
experiment. Assuming a grave and austere countenance, he thus
addressed him:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Boy, it is either thou thyself or the devil that abhorrest these words
of the Gospel; and if it be the devil, there is no doubt of his understanding
all languages, so that he cannot but know and show his
abhorrence when I recite the same sentence out of the Gospel in the
Greek text; but if it be thyself, then thou art an execrable wretch, who
playest the devil's part in loathing that portion of the Gospel of Christ,
which above all other scripture doth express the admirable union of
the Godhead in one Christ and Saviour, which union is the arch pillar
of man's salvation. Wherefore look unto thyself, for now thou art to
be put unto trial, and mark diligently whether it be the same scripture
which shall be read unto thee out of the Greek Testament, at the
reading whereof in the English tongue thou dost seem to be so much
troubled and tormented."
</p>
<p>
This experiment succeeded, for neither the boy nor the devil understood
the Greek version.</p></div>

Cromwell's army; and as almost all this regiment of saints considered
themselves in St. Paul's dragoons, our drummer occasionally preached,
exhorted, and expounded. When the Parliamentary army was disbanded,
or put under other commanders, the manners of the people had
a sudden and violent change; extreme strictness was succeeded by
universal dissipation, and the whole nation displayed their abhorrence
of their late rulers, and loyalty to their new sovereign, by general
licentiousness. A drum beat to a psalm tune would no longer attract
an audience; but still it was a favourite instrument, and our heroic
trooper, being free from military engagements, drummed his way
through the kingdom with a forged pass. Happening to beat up in the
neighbourhood of Tedworth, he attracted the notice of a Mr. Mompesson,
who seized the martial instrument, and punished the bearer.
From that time his ears were assailed by a perpetual drumming, and
his house for two or three years haunted by apparitions. It attracted
the notice of several of the neighbouring clergy, and his Majesty Charles
the Second, wishing to be satisfied about every particular, sent down a
number of persons to converse with this noisy spirit; but during the time
they stayed no spirit appeared, neither was the sound of a drum heard.
Notwithstanding this, poor dub-a-dub was tried at Salisbury assizes,
found guilty of being a wizard, and luckily escaped with only transportation
for life.

Mr. Glanville was the patriarch of witchcraft, and therefore a very
proper high priest in the temple of credulity. As his book gained him a
good benefice, and as a number of his proselytes consider <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sadducismus
Triumphatus</cite> entitled to equal credence with holy writ, I have subjoined
a few extracts for the edification of those who may not think the volume
from which they are taken worth perusal. It abounds with examples
of barbarity, flowing from a blind and bigoted credulity, at which
human nature shudders.
</p>
<p>
A relation of the strange witchcraft, discovered in the village of
Mohra, in Swedeland, about the year 1670:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The news of this witchcraft coming to the king's ear, his Majesty
was pleased to appoint commissioners, some of the clergy and some of
the laity, to make a journey to the town above mentioned to examine the
whole business. The commissioners met on the 12th of August at the
parson's house, and to them the minister and several people of fashion
complained, with tears in their eyes, of the miserable condition they
were in, and therefore begged of them to think of some way whereby
they might be delivered from that calamity. They gave the commissioners
very strange instances of the devil's tyranny among them:
how, by the help of witches, he had drawn some hundreds of children
to him, and made them subject to his power; how he hath been seen
to go in a visible shape through the country, and appeared daily to the
people; how he had wrought upon the poorer sort, by presenting them
with meat and drink, and this way allured them to himself; with other
circumstances to be mentioned hereafter. They therefore begged of the
Lords Commissioners to root out this hellish crew, that they might
regain their former rest and quietness; and the rather, because the
children, which used to be carried away in the country or district of
Esdaile, since some witches had been burnt there, remained unmolested.
</p>
<p>
"Examination being made, there were discovered no less than three-score
and ten witches in the village aforesaid; three-and-twenty of
which, freely confessing their crimes, were condemned to die; the rest,
one pretending she was with child, and the others denying, and pleading
not guilty, were sent to Faluna, where most of them were afterwards
executed.
</p>
<p>
"Fifteen children, which likewise confessed they were engaged in
this witchery, died as the rest; six-and-thirty of them, between nine
and sixteen years, who had been less guilty, were forced to run the
gauntlet: twenty more, who had no great inclination, yet had been
seduced to these hellish enterprises, because they were very young, were
condemned to be lashed with rods upon their hands for three Sundays
together, at the church door; and the aforesaid six-and-thirty were also
doomed to be lashed this way once a week for a whole year together.
The number of seduced children was about three hundred, etc. The
above narrative is taken out of the public register, where all this, with
more circumstances, is related."&mdash;<cite>Glanville</cite>, p. 494.
</p>
<p>
"At Stockholm, in the year 1676, a young woman accused her
mother of being a witch, and swore positively that she had carried her
away at night; whereupon both the judges and ministers of the town
exhorted the old woman to confession and repentance. But she stiffly
denied the allegations, pleaded innocence; and though they burnt
another witch before her face, and lighted the fire she was to burn in
before her, yet she still justified herself, and continued to do so till the
last; and remaining obstinate, was burnt. A fortnight or three weeks
after, her daughter, who had accused her, came to the judges in open
court (weeping and howling), confessed that she had accused her mother
falsely, out of a spleen she had against her for not gratifying her in a
thing she desired, and had charged her with a crime of which she was
perfectly innocent. Hereupon the judges gave orders for <em>her</em> immediate
execution."&mdash;Horneck's <cite>Introduction to a Narrative of Witchcraft, etc.</cite>&mdash;<cite>Glanville</cite>,
p. 481.
</p>
<p>
These are the horrid effects of credulity. For the dreadful devastations
made among the human race by superstition, we may read the
history of the Inquisition. Among myriads of examples, I was much
struck by the following:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Along with the Jews that were to be burnt at an <em>auto-da-fe</em>, there
was a girl not seventeen years of age, who, standing on that side where
the queen sat, petitioned for mercy. She was wonderfully pretty; and
looking at the queen, while her eyes streamed with tears, in a most
pathetic tone of voice exclaimed, 'Will not the presence of my sovereign
make an alteration in my fate? Consider how short a period I have
lived, and that I suffer for adherence to a religion which I imbibed
with my mother's milk. Mercy! mercy! mercy!' The queen turned
away her eyes,&mdash;was evidently moved by compassion, but&mdash;durst not
ask the holy fathers for even a respite."&mdash;<cite>M. d'Aunoy</cite>, p. 66.
</p>
<p>
What unlimited power! A queen dares not intercede for the pardon
of a young girl, guilty of no other crime than adhering to the faith of
her ancestors!
</p>
<p>
One of the most shocking circumstances that attend these consecrated
murders, is the indulgences which the Roman pontiffs have attached to
the executioners. Those who lead the poor condemned wretches to the
fire, and throw them into the flames, gain indulgences for one hundred
years. They who content themselves with only seeing them executed,
obtain fifty. What horror! The most detestable crimes, the most
unnatural cruelties, are made a means of obtaining pardons from the
God of mercy!</p></div>

dictator; and, in truth, the Secretary's own assertion in some
degree justified the supposition: "He would not be responsible for
measures which he was no longer allowed to guide." Whether the
artist was right or wrong in his opinion, I do not presume to assert: I
have endeavoured to describe characters as he has delineated them;
but with respect to this great man, the safest way will be to quote his
contemporaries. I have subjoined two portraits, drawn in his own
day; let the reader adopt that which pleases him best. They prove
how difficult it is to ascertain what were the abilities of a statesman
from any accounts given during his life. One party assert that Mr. Pitt
unites, with the eloquence of Cicero and the force of Demosthenes, the
conciseness of Sallust and the polished periods of Isocrates! Another,&mdash;but
to extract a part is not doing justice to the writers.
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chatham.</span></p>
<p>
"As this lord has long been dead to the world, we shall speak of
him as a man that has been.
</p>
<p>
"A remarkable reflection, arising from the character of Lord
Chatham, strikes us: No statesman was ever more successful, and no
statesman ever deserved less to have been so.
</p>
<p>
"This man entered into the army very early in life, and there he
ought to have remained. His enterprise, his rashness, and his scrupulous
sense of honour, were qualities extremely proper in the profession
of arms, and would have adorned any military station, except that of a
chief commander. But the field he renounced for the Cabinet, and
ceased to be a good soldier that he might be a bad statesman. In
nature, he was rash, impetuous, haughty, and uncontrollable; and these
dangerous properties were neither tempered nor improved by education.
To those advantages which are acquired by study, and those great
views which are communicated by habits of reflection, he was entirely
a stranger. His quickness was not corrected by judgment, and his
mind frequently was tired of the objects presented to it before it could
perceive or comprehend them. In a country where eloquence is little
known, his noise and vociferation acquired that name; and without
the experience of common sense, he was extolled as superior to Demosthenes
or Tully. His speeches were not wanting in fire, but they
were innocent of thought. He was perhaps the only man of his time
who could harangue for many hours without communicating one
distinct and well-digested idea to his audience. In estimating his own
merit he knew no bounds. His vanity was excessive: he saw every
man inferior to himself: on every man, therefore, he lavished his contempt.
Capricious to the most boyish excess, he was perpetually
forming resolutions, which he abandoned before he could put them in
execution. Yet his instability, through a fortuitous and whimsical
concurrence of circumstances, generally led the way to success. The
happy blunders of his administration procured him a reputation to
which he had no title. Every scheme he planned ought to have miscarried.
We admire his good fortune, not his wisdom. Popularity
was the idol to which he bowed&mdash;a certain proof that his conduct was
not influenced by those superior ideas which arise in high, liberal, and
virtuous minds. Yet to this idol he would have sacrificed everything:
it would have sacrificed everything to him. He possessed that intemperate
pride which, instead of guarding him from indecent errors, led
him to indiscretions; and a respectable character was seldom a security
from the licentious fury of his tongue. In private life he was restless,
fretful, unsocial, and perpetually affecting complaints which he did not
feel: in public life he was weak, headstrong, imprudent, and had no
quality of a good minister but enterprise. If he had continued in his
first profession, he might have served his country with honour; but his
ambition prompted him to assume the character of a statesman, and he
abused it.
</p>
<p>
"On the whole, he possessed virtues; but his passions hurried them
into excess, and he did not even wish to restrain them."
</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>Hear the other side:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Character of the late Earl of Chatham.</span></p>

<p>
"The Secretary stood alone; modern degeneracy had not reached
him; original and unaccommodating&mdash;the features of his character had
the hardihood of antiquity. No State chicanery, no narrow system of
vicious politics, no idle contest for ministerial victories, sunk him to the
vulgar level of the great; but overbearing and persuasive, his object
was&mdash;England; his ambition&mdash;fame! Without dividing, he destroyed
party; without corrupting, he made a venal age unanimous. France
sunk beneath him. With one hand he smote the house of Bourbon,
and wielded with the other the democracy of England. The sight of
his mind was infinite; and his schemes were to affect, not England
and the present age only, but Europe and posterity. Wonderful were
the means by which these schemes were accomplished; always seasonable,
always adequate, the suggestion of an understanding animated by
ardour, and enlightened by prophecy. The ordinary feelings which
make life amiable and indolent&mdash;those sensations which allure and
vulgarize&mdash;were unknown to him. A character so exalted, so strenuous,
so various, so authoritative, astonished a corrupt age, and the
Treasury trembled at the name of Pitt through all her classes of venality.
Corruption imagined, indeed, that she found defects in this statesman,
and talked much of the inconsistency of his glory, and much of
the ruin of his victories; but the history of his country and the calamity
of his enemies answered and refuted her. Nor were his political abilities
his only talents; his eloquence was an era in the senate, peculiar
and spontaneous, familiarly expressing gigantic sentiments and instinctive
wisdom: not like the torrent of Demosthenes, or the conflagration
of Tully; it resembled sometimes the thunder and sometimes
the music of the spheres. He did not conduct the understanding
through the painful subtlety of argumentation; nor was he for ever on
the rack of exertion, but rather lightened on the subject, and reached
the point by the flashings of the mind, which, like those of his eye,
were felt, but could not be followed. Upon the whole, there was in
this man something that could create, reform, or subvert; an understanding,
a spirit, and an eloquence to summon mankind to society, or
to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and rule the wildness of free
minds with unbounded authority: something that could establish or
overwhelm empire, and strike a blow in the world that should resound
through the universe."
</p>
<p>
At the time of Lord Chatham being interred, it was intimated in the
public prints that an epitaph descriptive of his talents and services
was to be inscribed on his tombstone; and that any one writing such
an epitaph would render an acceptable service to the committee who
had the management of his monument. The following was sent, but
as it was unkindly rejected by them, it is here inserted:&mdash;

explanation:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The subject of this print is, as its title expresses it, 'The Times.'
The first object is a quarter of the globe on fire, supposed to be Europe;
and France, Germany, and Spain, denoted by their respective arms,
are represented in flames, which appear to be extending themselves to
Great Britain itself. And this desolation is continued and increased by
Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, who is represented by the figure of Henry <span class="fs80">VIII.</span>, with a pair
of bellows blowing up those flames which others are endeavouring to
extinguish. He is mounted on the stilts of the populace. There is a
Cheshire cheese hanging between his legs, and round the same '£3000
per annum.' The manager of the engine-pipe is L&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;, who is
assisted in working the engine by sailors, English soldiers, and Highlanders;
but their good offices are impeded by a man with a wheel-barrow,
overladen with <cite>Monitors</cite> and <cite>North Britons</cite>, brought to be
thrown in to keep up the flame. The respectable body depictured
under Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, are the m&mdash;&mdash; of London, who are worshipping the
idol they had formerly set up; whilst a German prince, who alone is
sure to profit by the war, is amusing himself with a violin among his
miserable countrymen. It is sufficiently apparent who is meant by the
fine gentleman at the dining-room window of the Temple Coffeehouse,
who is squirting at the director of the engine-pipe, whilst his garretteers
are engaged in the same employment. The picture of the Indian alludes
to the advocates for the retaining our West India conquests, which, they
say, will only increase excess and debauchery; and the breaking down
the Newcastle Arms, and the drawing up the patriotic ones, refer to the
resignation of a noble Duke, and the appointment of a successor. The
Dutchman smoking his pipe, with a fox peeping out beneath him, the
emblem of cunning, waiting the issue; the waggon with the treasures of
the Hermione; the unnecessary marching of the militia, signified by the
Norfolk jig; the dove with the olive branch; and the miseries of war,
are obvious, and need no explication."

bulk of carcase, treading on Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, represented by 3000. The
bellows may signify his well-meant though ineffectual endeavours to
extinguish the fire by wind, which, though it will put out a small flame,
will cherish a large one. The guider of the engine-pipe I should think
can only mean his M&mdash;&mdash;, who unweariedly tries, by a more proper
method, to stop the flames of war, in which he is assisted by all his
good subjects both by sea and land, notwithstanding any interruption
from <cite>Auditors</cite> or <cite>Britons</cite>, <cite>Monitors</cite> or <cite>North Britons</cite>. The respectable
body at the bottom can never mean the magistrates of London: Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; has more sense than to abuse so respectable a body. Much less
can it mean the judges. I think it may as likely be the Court of Session
in Scotland, either in the attitude of adoration, or with outspread arms,
intending to catch their patron should his stilts give way. The
Frenchman may very well sit at his ease among his miserable countrywomen,
as he is not unacquainted that France has always gained by
negotiating what she lost in fighting. The fine gentleman at the window,
with his garretteers, and the barrow of periodical papers, refers
to the present contending parties of every denomination. The breaking
of the Newcastle Arms alludes to the resignation of a great personage;
and the replacing of them by the sign of the Four Clenched Fists may
be thought emblematical of the great economy of his successor. The
Norfolk jig signifies in a lively manner the alacrity of all his Majesty's
forces during the war; and G. T. (George Townshend) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fecit</i>, is an opportune
compliment paid to Lord Townshend, who, in conjunction with
Mr. Wyndham, published <cite>A Plan of Discipline for the use of the Norfolk
Militia</cite>, quarto, and had been the greatest advocate for the establishment
of our present militia. The picture of the Indian alive from America,
is a satire on our late uncivilised behaviour to the three chiefs of the
Cherokee nation who were lately in this kingdom, and the bags of
money set this in a still clearer point of view, signifying the sums gained
by showing them at our public gardens. The sly Dutchman with his
pipe seems pleased with the combustion, from which he thinks he shall
be a gainer; and the Duke of Nivernois, under the figure of a dove, is
coming from France to give a cessation of hostilities to Europe."</p></div>

from his face having been originally etched without features, and a nose

its similarity to an engraving after the design of a noble marquis, I
have denominated Lord Winchelsea. A higher figure, on his left hand,
is possibly the Duke of Bedford; the interrogating profile, with a hat

numerous squinting portraits on tobacco papers and halfpenny ballads,
inscribed with the name of John Wilkes, are 'a weak invention of the

might probably allude to personal satire, and the bard's warmest admirers
must admit, that though his characters are highly drawn, and still more
highly coloured, they are rather political than historical, rather poetical
than biographical. An uneducated painter, who had not taste enough
to conceive that poetry, however animated, could make that truth
which he knew to be falsehood, might possibly give his opinion in very
displeasing terms.</p></div>

contest between the pencil and the pen, was inserted in the prints of the
day. The following explanation, indifferent as it may be thought, is
the best I happen to have seen:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The bear with a tattered band represents the former strength and
abilities of Mr. Hogarth; the full pot of beer likewise shows that he
was in a land of plenty. The stump of a headless tree, with the
notches, and on it written 'Lie,' signifies Mr. Hogarth's former art, and
the many productions thereof, wherein he has excelled even nature
itself, and which of course must be but lies, flattery, and fallacy, the
painter's prerogative; and the stump of a tree only being left, shows
that there can be no more fruit expected from thence, but that it only
stands as a record of his former services. The butcher's dog trampling
on Mr. Churchill's Epistle alludes to the present state of Mr. Hogarth,
who is now reduced from the strength of a bear to a blind butcher's dog,
not able to distinguish, but degrading, his best friends; or perhaps
giving the public a hint to read that Epistle, where his case is more fully
laid before them. The next matter to be explained is the subscription-box,
and under it is a book said to contain <em>A List of Subscribers to the
North Briton</em>, as well as one of <em>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</em>. Mr.
Hogarth mentioned the <cite>North Briton</cite> to avoid the censure of the rabble
in the street, who he knew would neither pity nor relieve him; and as
Mr. Churchill was reputed to be the writer of that paper, it would seem
to give a colour in their eyes of its being intended against Mr. Churchill.
Mr. Hogarth meant only to show his necessity, and that a book entitled
<em>A List of Subscribers to the North Briton</em> contained in fact a list of
those who should contribute to the support of Mr. Hogarth in old age.
By the book entitled <em>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</em>, he can only
mean this, that when a man is become disabled to get his livelihood
and much in debt, the only shift he has left is to go a-begging to his
creditors.

the very ingenious baptisms of sundry modern prints would have given
ample countenance to the old inscription. For example: A girl hugging
a dog in her arms is, with great attention to analogy, called
"Nature;" and a woman with a large mallet in one hand, and a
tenpenny nail in the other, "Art."
</p>
<p>
A female with a consumptive curd-and-whey countenance, that would
not have got her a lover even in Otaheite, they have miscalled "Beauty;"
and a little gorged misshapen boy, with swollen cheeks, and a bow and
arrow, they kindly inform you is "Love."
</p>
<p>
A farmer's daughter with a basket on her arm, in which are two
pigeons quarrelling for a straw, and drawing it different ways, is
christened "Conjugal Peace;" and a very picturesque landscape, with
a crowd of figures in the background, baptized "Solitude!"

office guilty of extortion, cruelty, breach of trust, and many other
crimes; he accumulated a considerable fortune, and died at ninety
years of age. His son William was educated for holy orders, and sent
to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M.A., but
on the death of his elder brother gave up all thoughts of entering into
the church. In 1757 some flattering verses were addressed to him on
his version of Ariosto: they are preserved in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>,
vol. xxvii. p. 180; but, except by the author and the person to whom
they are written, were probably never read through. A specimen of
his translation from Dante, which was published in the <cite>British Magazine</cite>
for 1760, exhibits an unequivocal proof that Mr. Huggins was worthy
of his encomiast. He died the 2d of July 1761, and left to posterity
a <span class="fs80">MS.</span> tragedy, a <span class="fs80">MS.</span> translation of Dante, a <span class="fs80">MS.</span> farce, and though last,

He died in 1750, aged seventy years, and gives one additional name

who, saith my author, "generally live unto a greater age than persons
in any other way of life, from their souls being so attuned unto harmony,
that they enjoy a perpetual peace of mind." It has been observed, and
I believe justly, that thinking is a great enemy to longevity, and that,

In less than twelve moons the professor of astronomy died, and the

the house of a Doctor Cheyne Harte, in Shrewsbury, and I remember
his person having a strong resemblance to this print. I also recollect
that he carried his gold, silver, and copper coin in his coat pocket. He
had uncommon skill in his profession, but was ridiculously ostentatious,
and is said to have expended near a thousand guineas in a set of gold
instruments. At this species of foppery Hogarth has well hinted, in
the laced or Dresden ruffles with which he alone is decorated. His
portrait was painted at Rome by the Chevalier Riche. Beneath it is
the following inscription: "Joannes Taylor, Medicus in Optica expertissimus,

guineas was run for at Epsom. A mare, called Mrs. Mapp, won the
first heat, when Mrs. Mapp gave the rider a guinea, and swore, if he
won the plate she would give him a hundred."
</p>
<p>
<em>September 23, 1736.</em> "Mrs. Mapp continues making extraordinary
cures: she has now set up an equipage, and on Sunday waited on her
Majesty."
</p>
<p>
<em>October 19, 1736, London Daily Post.</em> "Mrs. Mapp being present at
the acting of <cite>The Wife's Relief</cite>, concurred in the universal applause of
a crowded audience. This play was advertised by the desire of Mrs.
Mapp, the famous bone-setter from Epsom."
</p>
<p>
<em>October 21, 1736.</em> "On Saturday evening there was such a concourse
of people at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln's-Inn Fields to see the famous
Mrs. Mapp, that several ladies and gentlemen were obliged to return
for want of room. The confusion at going out was so great, that several
ladies and gentlemen had their pockets picked, and many of the former
lost their fans, etc. Yesterday she was elegantly entertained by Doctor
Ward, at his house in Pall Mall."
</p>
<p>
"On Saturday, and yesterday, Mrs. Mapp performed several operations
at the Grecian Coffeehouse, particularly one upon a niece of Sir
Hans Sloane,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> to his great satisfaction, and her credit. The patient
had her shoulder-bone out for about nine years."
</p>
<p>

<p><a name="Footnote_191_191" id="Footnote_191_191"></a><a href="#FNanchor_191_191"><span class="label">[191]</span></a> He was originally in partnership with his brother, a drysalter in
Thames Street. By a fire which broke out in an adjoining house, their
joint property was destroyed, and Mr. Ward escaped by clambering
over the tops of several houses in his shirt.
</p>
<p>
In the year 1717 he was returned member for Marlborough, but by
a vote of the House of Commons declared not duly elected. It is
imagined that he was in some manner connected with his brother John
Ward (immortalized by Mr Pope) in the South Sea Bubble, for he left
England rather abruptly; and during his residence abroad, is supposed
to have turned Roman Catholic.
</p>
<p>
It was during his exile that he acquired such a knowledge of medicine
and chemistry as was afterwards the means of raising him to a state of
affluence. About the year 1733 he began to practise physic, and combated
for some time the united efforts of argument, jealousy, and ridicule,
by each of which he was opposed. By some lucky cures, and particularly
one on a relation of Sir Joseph Jekyl, Master of the Rolls, he
triumphed over his enemies; was, by a vote of the House of Commons,
exempted from being visited by the censors of the college, and called
in to the assistance of George the Second, whose hand he cured; and
in lieu of a pecuniary compensation, was, at his own request, permitted
to ride in his gaudy and heavy equipage through St. James's Park, an
honour seldom granted to any but persons of rank. Besides this, the
King gave a commission to his nephew, the late General Gansel.
</p>
<p>
He distributed medicine and advice to the poor gratis. There is as
bad a print as I have seen representing him thus employed. By such
conduct he acquired great popularity, and was, indeed, entitled to great
praise.
</p>
<p>
He died December 21, 1761, at a very advanced age, and left the
receipts for compounding his medicines to Mr. Page, member for
Chichester, who bestowed them on two charitable institutions, which
have derived considerable advantage from the profits attending their sale.
</p>
<p>
In the <cite>London Chronicle</cite> for February 27, 1762, is the following
intimation:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"A monument is going to be erected in Westminster Abbey, next
to that of Mr. Dryden's, to the memory of Joshua Ward, of Whitehall,

removed by the publication of Doctor Buchan's <cite>Domestic Medicine</cite>,&mdash;a
treatise which I have frequently heard reprobated by gentlemen of the
Faculty, for laying open to the world, in language so perspicuous, those
mysterious secrets which had been before disguised in dog Latin: it
has, however, gone through more editions than any book in this language,

claim, neither will an action lie; but if his patient dieth, an action
against the executors is good: the Court will admit the claim, and the
jury find a verdict, with full costs of suit.
</p>
<p>
This is very proper, and proveth that <em>law</em> and <em>equity</em> are the same;
and that if a physician <em>doth his business</em>, he can recover his reward;
but if he neglecteth, and <em>his patient doth not die</em>, why should he have
any remuneration?</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_194_194" id="Footnote_194_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> What caricature is in painting, burlesque is in writing; and in
the same manner the comic writer and painter correlate to each other.
But here I shall observe, that as in the former the painter seems to
have the advantage, so it is in the latter infinitely on the side of the
writer; for the monstrous is much easier to paint than describe, and
the ridiculous to describe than paint. And though perhaps this latter
species doth not in either science so strongly affect and agitate the
muscles as the other, yet it will be owned, I believe, that a more
rational and useful pleasure arises to us from it.
</p>
<p>
"He who should call the ingenious Hogarth a burlesque painter,
would, in my opinion, do him very little honour; for sure it is much
easier, much less the subject of admiration, to paint a man with a nose or
any other feature of a monstrous size, or to expose him in some absurd
or monstrous attitude, than to express the affections of men on canvas.
It has been thought a vast commendation of a painter to say, his figures
seem to breathe; but surely it is a much greater and nobler applause,
that they appear to think."
</p>
<p>
This is Fielding's opinion, and the <em>fiat</em> of such a writer ought to have
great weight; for his characters and Hogarth's pictures are drawn
from the same source.</p></div>

country, and would alone give celebrity and immortality to the English
school, in his picture of "Elysium," or the state of final retribution,

he subdued unhappy, must be admitted, and is to be lamented.
Though I am inclined to suspect that the narrations of Bartholomew
de las Casas, and some other writers, are greatly exaggerated, we have
indisputable evidence of such oppression, murder, and massacre, as
must make every reader shudder. If the same system is still pursued,&mdash;and
I fear it has been but little softened,&mdash;the evil will correct itself; and
who will not rejoice at the total extirpation of these merciless tyrants, and
emancipation of that unhappy race whom they have so long enslaved?
Let us not, from this, censure the extension of commerce, or civilisation
of the savage; for both these great objects ultimately tend to make
men wiser, better, and happier. To the beardless philosopher, who
adopts the fascinating visions of Rousseau, is an advocate for the
blessings of barbarism, and contends for the superiority of the savage
to the civilised animal, I earnestly recommend the perusal of Mickle's
<cite>Introduction to the Lusiad</cite>. If the arguments adduced by that excellent
writer&mdash;and, from intimate personal knowledge, I venture to add,
excellent man&mdash;will not convince him, and he still languishes for pathless
wilds, let him retreat from civilised society to the frozen rocks of
Kamtschatka, or join the Aborigines of New Holland.</p></div>

giving his name to this new half of the globe, in which he did not
possess one acre of land; and pretended to be the first who discovered
the continent. Admitting it true that he first discovered it, the glory
is due to the man who had the penetration to see that the voyage was
practicable, and the courage to perform it. Columbus made three
voyages, as viceroy and admiral, five years before Americus made one
as a geographer; but Vespucius writing to his friends at Florence that
he had discovered a new world, they took his word, and the citizens
decreed that a grand illumination should be made before the door of his
house every three years, on the feast of All Saints. Such are the accidents
by which honours are attained. A merchant gives his name to

when once asked why he did not answer them, replied, that "he had
not seen one which promised to live so long as it would take to engrave
a plate." A few of these poignant satires I have seen; but they have
now attained a black letter value, and are seldom to be found except in
the cabinets of the curious. A series of six or eight, beginning with one
entitled "The Butifyer, or a Touch on the Times," Plate I., were designed
and engraved by an artist of deserved celebrity.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> With a frankness for

Magazines</cite> for 1761; part of it I have subjoined:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Over the first row is written the title Episcopal. The first capital
discovers only a forked nose, lips, and one eye; the rest of the face is
eclipsed by the wig's protuberance. The next three etchings are only
the hinder parts of heads; by these Mr. Hogarth satirizes the present
age for their immoralities, which are so notorious, that three-fifths of
the religious orders turn their backs upon us, not being able to behold
such wickedness.
</p>
<p>
"The last visage in the line is marked with true pedantic contempt;
the wig's fore-top is like the forked hill of Parnassus, and there is a roll
round the forehead, like a <span class="fs80">MS.</span> scroll; the eyelids are almost closed,
which denotes <em>the wise man's wink</em>, or that he can see the world with
half an eye. The muscles of the countenance are curled up into disdain,
and he seems to say, 'I despise ye, ye illiterati!'
</p>
<p>
"The immense quantity of grizzle which is wove into the wigs carries
a twofold design&mdash;for reverence and for warmth. The make of these
canonicals evinces the care this order take of themselves, for the sake of
those committed to their trust; and the profusion of curls or friz in each
denotes the wearer must be most learned, because, as the country folk
say, Why should they put a double coat of thatch upon a barn, without
there was a greater proportion than ordinary of grain housed therein?
</p>
<p>
"The next row is inscribed Aldermanic. The first wig has two ends,
exactly like the dropsical legs of some over-gorged glutton; and the
three-quartered face indicates Plenty, Porter, and Politics. On the
brow, domestical significancy is seated; a look necessary to each
master who dozes in his arm-chair on the Sunday evening, while his
lady reads prayers to the rest of the family. It is a countenance which
carries dignity with it even at the upper end of a table at a turtle-eating.
</p>
<p>
"The second has one lock dependent like a sheep's bushy tail. This
man could make speeches, knew the nature of debentures, and was
much harassed by cent. per cent. commerce. Many are the sleepless
nights he has passed in scheming how to fix, if for only half a day, the
fluctuating chances of 'Change Alley.

"The third wig is, as the sailors say, 'all aback.' By the swelling
of the full bottom, we have an idea of Magna Charta consequence, and
guess that the wearer would say something&mdash;if he could but see it.

"The next is parted triangular-wise, to fall each side the shoulders.
This design was originally taken from a nutting-stick. Thus one of our
finest capitals was delineated from a square tile, a weed, and a basket.
</p>
<p>
"With all modest conjecture we presume, from our intense application
to mathematics, that the semicircular sweep at the end of the last full
bottom signifies a gold chain. But as we are Englishmen, and will
have nothing to do with chains, we shall hasten to the wigs and chins
in the third, entitled 'Lexonical.'
</p>
<p>
"Great men are always celebrated for great things: Cicero for his
wart; Ovid for a nose almost equal to Slawkenbergius'; and this portrait
seems to be ushered into notice by the curvature of the chin. How
venerably elegant do these Lexonicals appear! Here is indeed law at
full length. Special pleadings in the fore-top; declarations, replications,
rejoinders, issues, and demurrers in every buckle. The knotty
points of practice in the intricacies of the twisted tail, and the depth of
the whole wig, emblematically express the length of a Chancery suit,
while the black coif behind looks like a blister."</p></div>

verse to entertain a noble audience or to express a noble passion. And

indulgent to this poem, as to allow it no inconsiderable place. Since,
therefore, to the Court I owe its fortune on the stage; so, being now

<p>"Connection of the <cite>Indian Emperor</cite> to the <cite>Indian Queen</cite>.
</p>
<p>
"The conclusion of the <cite>Indian Emperor</cite> (part of which poem was
written by me) left little matter for another story to be built on, there
remaining but two of the considerable characters alive, viz. Montezuma
and Orazia: thereupon the author of this thought it necessary to produce
new persons from the old ones; and considering the late Indian
Queen, before she loved Montezuma, lived in clandestine marriage
with her great general Traxalla, from those two he has raised a son and
two daughters, supposed to be grown up to man and woman's estate,
and their mother Orazia (for whom there was no further use in the
story) lately dead. So that you are to imagine about twenty years
elapsed since the coronation of Montezuma, who in the truth of the
history was a great and glorious prince, and in whose time happened
the discovery and invasion of Mexico by the Spaniards (under the
command of Cortez), who joined with the Traxallan Indians, the
inveterate enemies of Montezuma, wholly subverted that flourishing
empire, the conquest of which is the subject of this dramatic poem.
</p>
<p>
"I have neither wholly followed the story, nor varied from it, and,
as near as I could, have traced the native simplicity and ignorance of
the Indians in relation to European customs: the shipping, armour,
horses, swords, and guns of the Spaniards, being as new to them as
their habits and manners were to the Christians.
</p>
<p>
"The difference of their religion from ours, I have taken from the
story itself; and that which you find of it in the first and fifth acts,
touching the sufferings and constancy of Montezuma in his opinions, I
have only illustrated, not altered from those who have written of it.

A spacious Gothic gallery made an admirable theatre, and for scenery&mdash;there
was an excellent substitute, in many a mouldering breadth of
ancient tapestry, which represented in horrid guise the direful tale of
Herod's Cruelty. By the hour announced for the theatrical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> of
these unfledged actors, the house overflowed. Though the circumstance
is not recorded by either Boswell or Sir John Hawkins, a late celebrated
moralist was one of the audience. To the beginning of the fifth act he
stayed with more patience than could have been expected; at this time
he exhibited evident marks of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> and lassitude&mdash;yawned three times,
and attempted to make his exit. The lady of the mansion cut off his
retreat with, "'Pon honour, Doctor Johnson, you must not go! How
can you think of leaving the theatre when my Dicky is in so interesting
a situation?" "Madam," replied the sage, "with the plot of your play
I was unacquainted, and have waited thus long in the hope that it would
turn out a tragedy; I might then have seen how naturally little Dicky
and his dramatic associates would have died! I now perceive that the
author will neither introduce aconite nor a bare bodkin, and have no
prospect of a pathetic termination but in Herod or some of his tapestry
hang-dogs starting into life. Should these murderous ruffians once step
upon the stage, all your pretty innocents will most assuredly be put to

of a newspaper with the following remarks (neither the date nor title of
the paper were inserted): "Whether the late extraordinary sums paid
for the works of Hogarth at Mr. Gulston's sale are to be regarded on
the whole as proofs of our artist's merit, or of extravagance in our
modern collectors, I shall not venture to determine; and yet the
following statement of the rapid advance in the value of prints from
this celebrated master may furnish notices to assist the judgment of
your readers:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"In 1780, Mr. Walpole obliged the world with a fourth volume of
his <cite>Anecdotes of Painting in England</cite>. In this entertaining performance
was comprised the first catalogue of Hogarth's pieces. I say the first,
for every preceding enumeration of them was defective in the extreme.
This was succeeded in 1781 by a publication from the ingenious and
accurate Mr. Nichols, who considerably enlarged and amended the
list made by his predecessor.
</p>
<p>
"In the same year, Mr. Bailley's collection, which would now be
deemed an imperfect one, was sold at Christie's for £61, 10s. In 1782
it was resold, with some additions, at Barford's for £105.
</p>
<p>
"In 1785, the late Mr. Henderson of Covent Garden Theatre disposed
of his collection, by far less complete than either of the foregoing,
for £126.
</p>
<p>
"In 1786, Mr. Gulston's was sold piecemeal by Mr. Greenwood;
and though the condition of all such articles in it, as real taste and
common sense would style the most valuable, were very indifferent, the
whole series is reported to have brought in upwards of £600.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> At this

"Should the celebrity of the delightful mock heroic poem, or the
rareness of an imperfect play tending to show that a complete design is
not always to be hit at once even by a Hogarth, furnish some apology
for the purchase of the two last articles, what excuse can be invented
for the collectors who bought the preceding trash on terms so ridiculously
high? Of all the trifling works of art, coats of arms must be reckoned
the most contemptible. These early productions of our author on silver
tea-tables, mugs, and waiters, have no sort of merit to recommend them,
nor were ever meant to be impressed on paper (except as in momentary
satisfaction to the engraver); for being there reversed, like the prayers
of witches, they must be read backwards. Besides, what taste or genius
can be manifested in the disposition of a cat's whiskers or a fox's tail;
in the emblazonry of a black swan with two necks, or a blue boar with
gilded tail? What abilities are requisite for the expansion of an old
woman's furred cloak (very pompously denominated a mantle) at the
back of a shield, or for inscribing some bright sentence or wretched
pun (yclep'd a motto) in Gothic Latin on a ribbon fantastically waved?
For the design in which nature and manners are displayed, no praise
can be too exalted; but as for his heraldry,&mdash;his representation of birds
and beasts that never had existence,&mdash;

</div></div>

<p>
these can never be allowed to contribute a single leaf to the chaplet he
has so long and so deservedly worn.
</p>
<p>
"I have dwelt the more on these things, because I am assured there
are print-dealers now rummaging the books of our oldest engravers, in
the hope that a still greater number of useless and insignificant particulars
consisting of arms, etc., imputable to Hogarth, will be found;
nor are their hopes less sanguine that the madness of collectors will be
confirmed instead of cured by the examples hung out at the late auction
in Leicester Fields.
</p>
<p>
"Let me hope, however, that for the future every sensible collector
will think his assemblage of Hogarth's prints sufficiently complete, without
the foolish adjuncts already described and reprobated. For the
authenticity of these trifles being obvious to no kind of proof, they
principally tend to expose their purchasers to the frauds of designing
people, who will laugh at their credulity while they pocket their cash."</p></div>

⁂ The <span class="smcap">Pills To Purge Melancholy</span> <em>have now retained their celebrity for a
century and a half. The difficulty of obtaining a copy has of late years raised sets
to a fabulous price, and has made even odd volumes costly. Considering the classical
reputation which the book has thus obtained, and its very high interest as
illustrative of the manners, customs, and amusements of English life during the
half century following the Restoration, no apology is needed for placing such a work
more within the reach of general readers and students by re-issuing it for the first
time since its original appearance, and at about a tithe of the price for which
the old edition could now be obtained.</em></div>

<em>For drinking-songs and love-songs, sprightly ballads, merry stories, and political
squibs, there are none to surpass these in the language. In improvising such
pieces, and in singing them</em>, <span class="smcap">D'urfey</span> <em>was perhaps never equalled, except in our
own century by</em> <span class="smcap">Theodore Hook</span>. <em>The sallies of his wit amused and delighted
three successive English sovereigns; and while his plays are forgotten, his songs
and ballads still retain the light</em> abandon <em>and joyous freshness that recommended
them to the wits and beaux of Queen Anne's days. Nor can the warm and affectionate
eulogy of Steele and Addison be forgotten, and</em> <span class="smcap">D'urfey</span> <em>may now take his

⁂ <em>Of the Poets of the Restoration, there are none whose works are more rare
than those of Sir John Mennis and Dr. James Smith. The small volume entitled
"Musarum Deliciæ; or, The Muses' Recreation," which contains the productions
of these two friends, was not accessible to Mr. Freeman when he compiled his
"Kentish Poets," and has since become so rare that it is only found in the cabinets
of the curious. A reprint of the "Musarum Deliciæ," together with several other
kindred pieces of the period, appeared in 1817, forming two volumes of Facetiæ,
edited by Mr. E. Dubois, author of "The Wreath," &amp;c. These volumes having in
turn become exceedingly scarce, the Publishers venture to put forth the present new
edition, in which, while nothing has been omitted, no pains have been spared to
render it more complete and elegant than any that has yet appeared. The type,
plates, and woodcuts of the originals have been accurately followed; the notes of
the Editor of 1817 are considerably augmented, and indexes have been added,
together with a portrait of Sir John Mennis, from a painting by Vandyke in Lord
Clarendon's Collection.</em></div>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
